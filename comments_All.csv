And the new angels suck but at least adriana and ale was there but still candice, lily and behati wasn't there. So fuck this shit.","VS"

I wouldn't know she was an angel unless it was for Instagram. It just shows how little the status of angel means to VS anymore. Sad, really.","VS"
"love victoria secret","VS"
"The ""new angels hate"" isn't even about the new girls, it's just that the brand is aiming for their teenage group, because that's the girls who buy their products now a days. I'm sick of disliking Victoria's Secret for going new ways. If they want a younger feel to their brand, that's great, but it's not for me, which is fine, tons of other lingerie brands. :)","VS"

"Taylor is goals","VS"
"Everything about this video belongs in the pink section. The girls are really pretty but being pretty and appealing/sexy are two separate things. They don't have the appeal that is typical of Victoria secret angels. Plus there is no individual spark to these girls like there was with Adriana or Candice or even Tyra. Sorry.","VS"

"I hope one day they'll start accepting us 5'4 height girls.. Honestly they should allow the small girls to have some spotlight, but of course I love these girls so much! Especially Taylor!!","VS"
"Wtf","VS"
"This commercial is perfect. The Josephine, Lais and Taylor models are sexy, real angels, unique beauty. Just missed Elsa and Sara to complete the team. Top choices Victoria's Secret, Elsa, Josephiner, Lais, Sara and Taylor. New angels bombshells !!!","VS"

No.","VS"

"It's awkward to see Taylor being ""sexy"" ,she's sooooooo gorgeous but she looks too young imo","VS"
"still cant believe candice and behati are pregnant omg","VS"
"This seems more like a PINK commercial. The new angels look a little young. Theyre very beautiful and I love them, but you should wait like a year or so. They all will grow into bombshells, but right now is not the right time to be using them for adult lingerie. It also doesnt help that the colors are bright and neon. Doesnt scream sexy to me. Still love them though😍","VS"

"VS please put all of the new angels in the pink section they're killing the brand they don't fit into the adult lingerie. Let the veterans take the lead for the sexiness of commercials and everything.","VS"
"I don't like the ""girl next door"" aesthetic for Victoria's Secret. I know it's an issue of personal taste but these are not goddesses. They are young and pretty, but lack the presence of the true angels. Very underwhelming ad. Sorry, VS.","VS"
"Taylor just look more like a college girl instead of a angle. When I think of the angles I think of grown women not college girls. Save that for PINK","VS"

"I love bee","VS"
"Taylor is goals","VS"
"Everything about this video belongs in the pink section. The girls are really pretty but being pretty and appealing/sexy are two separate things. They don't have the appeal that is typical of Victoria secret angels. Plus there is no individual spark to these girls like there was with Adriana or Candice or even Tyra. Sorry.","VS"
"Behati, Lais and Jo slay in this.","VS"
"No Sara ...This is a Taylor😤","VS"
"What the hell taylor doing here get out","VS"

"Wtf","VS"

"this is how i click off x","VS"
"THE VIDEO AND THE SONG IS PERFECT!","VS"
"I love Taylor so much!!","VS"
"I think that it is pretty telling that Candice is most mentioned even when she is not in commercial! Wake up VS, she is the only angel people care about, when Adriana leaves, you will only have Candy and when she leaves too  you can say goodbye to your brand!","VS"
"Pornhub is down","VS"

"Ha ha ha...

I guess you didn't like my comment about what a sexless commercial and brand Victoria's Secret happens to be.

Just how brittle is your perceptions of your own brand when you resort to deleting Youtube comments?

Pathetic - just like your fashion shows.","VS"

"Where can I find this song? It's like a freaking unicorn.","VS"
"Am I the only one who actually likes the fact that these girls have the kind of cute sexy girl next door look? Like I actually don't mind that they're younger because guess what! It isn't just 20 year olds buying the underwear! It's teens like myself too!","VS"

"alot of complaining in this comment section..doubt any male has a woman as sexy as these..(and I don't mean sexy to you personally.. sexy in general) ..and if they do..they aren't a average guy you'd find at the grocery store...maybe its cause I'm young and in the age demographic...hell even if I was 50 I wouldn't give a fuck","VS"

"Lais is boring as hell 
you expect me to think wow! VS! so sexy! by using model who look tired all the time?","VS"
"adoro essas angels😍😚❤","VS"
"Honestly though who gives a shit about their models anymore. VS is no longer the elite brand it used to be. Like, they're literally owned by Bath and Body Works. Their lingerie is cheap as shit and I don't mean in price. And don't even get me started on those horrid neon graphic tees they continue to sell for some reason. The only people who wear VS apparel at my school are the free lunch recipients, and that really says something about a brand.","VS"
"The new young looking angels should stick to the pink section and let the veterans like Adriana or Alessandra be in these commercials","VS"
"I need to know where I can listen to this song that I am literally obsessing over. I can't find it anywhere. Help??","VS"

"OMG，pretty good！","VS"
"I dont like Stella.. :( she can't be an angel, for me her face isn't beautiful like other angel.. She is good for HF but not for VS.. sorry :(","VS"
"The commercial looks pretty good, but the models are sometimes so close to the camera that I find it quite difficult to keep track of what is going on.","VS"
"stella ❤","VS"
"The reason why they are so fit is because it is their job and they have to have a bikini body 24/7! It is nothing to do with fat shaming! I mean how dumb would they look advertising workout gear with their bellies hanging out?","VS"

"Well, that's good news for small-chested women like me, too bad though, since I can't afford to try these bralettes, lol","VS"
"finally won't need to go to walmart for my bra's :')","VS"
"My lovely wife was smaller breasted such as these ladies when she was younger, and I dug every single facet of her assets; still do, only more some 29 years later.  Why are some women complaining about this bralette? 
For crying out loud. Some people (in this case some complainant women) would bitch about being hanged with a new rope. Ugh. 
Women of all makes and models.....(Well, not all....so, I lied.) are beautiful in their own right. So, let the bralette babes alone. After all, they're not complaining about YOU having larger breasts. Instead, they're capitalizing on their own type of good fortune.","VS"
"Bralette ? thats perfect .
Branlette in french means a little quick hand relief","VS"
"Finally! Padded bras have always been nasty (and so are fake boobs). It's good to see a company sending a positive message to women to be confident with a smaller chest because it's no less sexy. Imagine how women would react if us guys routinely wore padded underwear to try to look more hung! Most women would either find it very sad or very funny (or both)!","VS"
"OMG, the natural boobs movement wins! Yass, small boobs are sexy and dont need padding and big boobs need to be held in place and not wobble around. Time to focus on those 2 things.","VS"
"i like it  because i have not much breast, and i hate bras they are way too uncomfortable (for anyone)  i hope there will be more diversity for now on.","VS"

"yes! this is so amazing, finally small boobs are having a say in advertisment! woo (not a feminist just flatchested af ;p ) now i can feel like i dont have to strap my tiny tits together and wear a $120 pushup bra to make it looks like i have nice tits. thank u evolving society","VS"

"Ale and adri is better","VS"
"Taylor is sweet-beautiful with her bedroom eyes. You can tell by which direction she cheered how accepted she is as a newcomer; she's already encroaching the spotlight from the others.","VS"
"If you can't use Candice then where is Elsa? Taylor and Martha are gorgeous but they're not Candice, or even near it.","VS"
"People are so judgey over the vs girls like wtf? So many people are like ""where's candice?! We want candice!!"" Well guess what you can't have candice all the time. And some people are like ""stop using Taylor she's so boring?"" Maybe Taylor is the only one who doesn't have a busy modelling schedule and is able to book these commercials more than the other girls. Candice may have a very busy schedule and you probably won't see her for every single vs commercial. Victoria's Secret are not going to listen to any of you so just stop. They will do it their way and if you love vs then you would be accepting of each Angel and the way this company runs. 
Every Angel is beautiful 💜 no one is boring","VS"

"What song is this?
My fav thing about Victoria Secret models- they make it big. They inspire young girls. And unlike other models, Victoria Secret Models are encouraged to eat a lot and work out a lot. Instead of focusing on being skinny, they're focusing on being fit.
That would be my ideal role model for myself and my younger might-be-some-day step sister.
I want this to be the standard of beauty and girls to be encouraged to be fit and healthy, eat right and work out, not to be skinny and bony, eat cotton and force yourself to throw up.

"Wow😍","VS"
"Tbh the reason why sports bras flatten your chest has many reasons, the biggest one is to stop your boobs flying all over the place when you run/jump/etc. Have you ever done mountain climbers when your chest hasn't been flattened, especially if you a bit more endowed? That crap is annoying and hurts. Have you ever played rugby without a flattened chest? Girls are vicious especially in rugby and some actually, try hitting your boobs hard enough that you'll let the ball go. Plus when you're tackling someone it stops the impact from suddenly squashing your boobs and hurting them, therefore reducing the chance of pain. Why do you think runners and swimmers intentionally flatten their chests? Because it makes them aerodynamic. Boobs can hinder your workout, thus the reason for flattening them. Also if your sports bra is hurting, you're obviously not buying the right size or brand. 
This is just so your boobs look good so you look cute while working out to please the expectations of others instead of fully focusing on why you are working out. Take this from a bigger girl who does work out 3-4 times a week, goes running and used to play rugby, both league, and union.","VS"
"i wear the vs sport bras for work and love it it's the best bras i've ever had for work","VS"
"Elsa my love!!!","VS"
"OMG Josephine is soooo cute :3","VS"
"Some people are saying that models have small boobs etc, womens with small boobs need support to you know..  Especially when they working out ,  small boobs are boobs lol","VS"
"""Feeling free without a bra"" is a concept that VS could work around for a new bra 😜","VS"
"I love jojo. She has so much spirit","VS"
"these 3 are the holy trinity of the new angels fight me if you think otherwise","VS"
"love he commercial :D","VS"
"love elsa","VS"
"OK  VS youtube channel now i have a crush om Josephine :/ i hope you are happy now","VS"
"These girls barely have any breasts to talk about. Seriously, why did they choose to interview the skinniest and flattest girls they could find? Instead, try your product out with some larger breast sizes. Unless, of course, your product isn't all that good. Hmm...","VS"
"Women.","VS"
"Adriana♡♡♡
She is very cool😎😎😎","VS"
"I actually really liked this, especially when jas said to jo “you just wanna touch my boob” this really shows their personality","VS"
"Elsa always reminds me of a gorgeous ice queen","VS"

"I've grown to like Josephine. Very Behati-like with her personality.","VS"
"Elsa's face is simply amazing.. Of course, Jo and Jas are very pretty, but they don't have such an unique shape of eyes, mouth, beautiful face profile..etc","VS"
"jasmine!!!!","VS"
"What is the name of these girls?","VS"

"Entrevista maravilhosa desta três belas modelos","VS"
"Jo, elsa, and jas are the best new angels glad to see them being used","VS"
"Chances are Behati wont be ready for the FB, so this year i really hope it either goes to Adriana , because hell nobody can open a show like her, or elsa because she's a TOTAL bombshell and has been working with the brand for a while","VS"
"You go Jo !!!!! 😍","VS"
"flat earth","VS"
"jasmine is so pretty man","VS"
"fuck I need to start working out","VS"
"Adriana Looks great","VS"
"loool josephine's personality really showed, I think because it wasn't scripted at all","VS"
"Yasssss","VS"
"Adriana Lima 💕","VS"
"The funny thing here is that they are talking about how supportive these bras are when you can clearly see that the one Jasmine is wearing is not supportive, like at all (0:37) and also how well-fitting they are when you can see the one Elsa is wearing through the whole talk (the black stripy one) clearly doesn't fit her at all but Adriana is wearing it and it looks good. 
My point here is that these bras are shown on boobless girls so they look flawless, I mean what kind of support they need when they wear AA cup? These bras are made for them, I can't wear a sports bra that has normal bra-like cup because I wouldn't get enough support from that, so for me wearing a 38C or D (depends on the actual cup size) I never found one that would be a nice fit and enough support in VSX plus from my personal experience when you have a 38c in two different styles they don't necessarily fit, because I bought one (online) thinking oh this is the same size I already have and it happened to be totally big on me, the cup I mean and that never happened to me with Nike sports bras for example. I think the way they advertise them is like the best sports bra in the world when the truth is they are totally not.","VS"
"I love how some complain ""thats not angel talk""... Guys and girls, they're just regular human beings like you and me","VS"
"I think VS Bras should have bigger sizes. I personally can't wear one even though I think they are so pretty!","VS"
"Finally seeing Adriana! I was scared she wasn't working with vs anymore","VS"
"I want a victoria secret sport bra, cuz my jiggling boobs need one. But they are expensive :'(","VS"
"Omg jasmine's voice is so low I love it","VS"

"They make me want to work out but I'm already as skinny as a twig.","VS"
"Some people say that these models give an unrealistic view of body image for girls. I actually find them super inspiring. Maybe I don't have to look exactly like them, but they motivate me to get in shape.","VS"
"Bring back the fun and vibrant colors and prints!! Makes working out so much more fun :) LOVE VICTORIA SPORT","VS"
"I dare anyone claim these girls have eating disorders...","VS"
"jasmine can rub my magic lamp","VS"
"I really admire VS for destroying the stereotype that models starve themselves and highlighting that they really do work hard and are in very good shape","VS"
"romee adriana  elsa  jas","VS"
"I love Adriana <3","VS"
"adriana lima the genetic mericle","VS"
"the one in orange is really ugly no offense I wonder why they hired her","VS"

"I am loooveeee how they make these","VS"
"now hopefully the woman at my gym take note!! skin tight camel toe hugging black leggings ain't sexy.  THIS IS SO WEAR IT!!!","VS"
"This is so amazing..","VS"
"No no no.  This is putting the whole ""every body is beautiful"" movement back five steps.  You do not have to have a perfectly toned body to be able to wear lingerie, or to feel confident in it.  Keep your body healthy and work it out because it makes you feel good, not so you can ""show it off.""  Be healthy, be you, be beautiful.","VS"
"Adriana Lima is a beast! She is so gorgeous","VS"
"Gonna watch this every time before I got to the gym!","VS"
"Adriana <3<3","VS"
"Amazing video","VS"
"So glad to see them using Adriana again","VS"
"They train hard but they starve harder.","VS"
"What is  VSX mean ?","VS"
"Jasmine est tout simplement magnifique 😍😍","VS"
"who are the twelve people who thumbs down this video?  either a faggot, or an old lady who is jealous because she don't look like the models probably never did even when she was young","VS"
"ahahah this is models not athlete","VS"
"This is actually quite inspiring, people always tend to jump into conclusions and say that the models starve themselves and cause eating disorders for girls but really, they are just doing their job, they work super hard for their bodies and a part of that comes from genetics too.","VS"
"(゜Д゜)wao!!!!!!!!
Adriana♡","VS"
"i love them so much!!!! Elsa jas and jo are my fav new angels","VS"
"So nice to see Adriana back","VS"
"Great text! Amazing ideals!!!!","VS"
"To girls/women everywhere: 
When you work out and eat right, don't hold these girls up as an ambition. Although they work hard for their bodies, a lot of what they have comes down to their genetics. So instead, do it for your mental and physical health. Then see how you are rewarded. Some girls will lose a lot of weight, other girls easily gain muscle. Basically, everybody responds differently to exercise. What's important to know, is that whatever happens; there is no greater celebration of your femininity than kicking ass at life and at the gym. 
So no matter what your body type, be proud of the commitments you've made to make your life better, and kick some ass!","VS"
"I get it, they're pretty girls. However, they look anorexic to me. There's no meat on the backend. However, I'm not endorsing getting fat.","VS"
"Is it true that VS is no longer doing swim and workout clothes?? It doesn't seem so. But I have heard that.","VS"
"The way the VS commercials go, they mix the new girls with one or two veteran Angels. If Candice and Behati are not pregnant, they will be here too.

The sad thing is they are not using much the Angel with nice boobs and a shapely hip - Lais Ribeiro. Maybe because she doesn't sell well? Kind of ironic how women view bodies. I just read an interview with a former VS retoucher and he said that when VS tried using voluptuous models they didn't sell well and had to let go of them, yet there are many women complaining that clothing companies use skinny models to promote their products.","VS"
"ahhh haaaaaa I miss Candice; *(**(","VS"
"I got a couple of VSX bras - very comfortable and the designs are cute. Cute enough to use while lounging around.

Adriana getting muscly in the arms is very nice.","VS"
"New logo","VS"
"Oh, I think I ate a little too much before watching this haha. I'll wait for it to digest but will workout tonight lol. This video was inspiring nonetheless","VS"

"VERY NICE!!","VS"
"guys are here for the...","VS"
"Adriana was made for VS Sport 💪💪. Elsa, Romee, Jojo and Jas look so good and fit perfectly VS sport too. I love how you promote exercise, hard work too get the body that you want. If you feel comfortable not being fit it's ok  and if you want to be fit it's ok too... The important thing here is to be healthy so if you want to lose some pounds the best way is with exercise and eating what your body needs (that is what is important to talk with a nutricionist) but if you don't want to, as I said, it's ok too 😊😊","VS"
"Beautiful","VS"
"So glad to see adriana. Now, I want to see alessandra in a commercial, launch event, campaign, catalogue, or anything. Her and adriana's time to leave vs are getting closer and closer. They are not going to be a vs angel forever, so.. Use them properly vs before their time as angels officially over.","VS"

"Excellent. Please upload more short duration videos like these featuring both Stella Maxwell, Elsa Hosk and also Sara Sampaio. And please focus less on music on your shows. It's very time killing and a big turn off. Your shows were much much better 8, 9 or 10 years ago. Focus more on angels. Everyone is here for them.","VS"

"Stella is amazing 😍","VS"
"I miss all the legendary angel. Candice, Miranda, Doutzen, Behati, Adriana, Alessandra, Lily.. and yes THE BAROQUE CONCEPT BACKGROUND! However they're still hot, and maybe they bring the new era of VS, love the model anyway, Stella Lais and Elsa. Oh yeah! I want Cara back!!!","VS"
"que esteorotipo mas repugnante de belleza tienen ¿ser delgada es sinonimo de belleza?","VS"
"Those blue eye shadows tho 😍","VS"
"Scientists show that 90% of the people watching this will go and start working out.","VS"
"Aren't these the same as the lounge bras and now they are calling them easy bras?","VS"
"Lais!!! She got more curves than Jasmine. With Candice pregnant, Elsa is the token VS blonde with hips for their current commercials.

I don't like the final cut of this video though. Whoever is the editor is probably some Candice fan who did a lousy a job because Candice isn't there (not hating on Candice fyi)","VS"
"MORE OF LAIS PLEASE","VS"
"Quen Lais <3 <3  (not a big fan of their makeup tho)","VS"
"living in india","VS"
"can't purchase em","VS"
"Amazing grils","VS"
"Naaah not feeling it looks like some college girls the old VS models got that sexy grown woman vibe","VS"
"""Easy"" just makes me think of sexually promiscuous to be honest. So the girls in their underwear with the word ""EASY"" slapped across them was more funny than enticing, to be honest, haha. I know that's not the intention of the ad, but still XD","VS"
"what song is this?","VS"
"what song is this?","VS"
"OH MY LAIS <3","VS"
"Finally Lais is in one of these videos. I feel like it's been forever since she's been in one.","VS"
"what happened with their eyes?","VS"
"I like Elsa but Stella looks like a walmart copy cat.","VS"
"Finally, Lais makes an appearance.","VS"
"listen, I dont care about the models like most of you seem to. 
I care about the fact that a store that exclusively sells female products has advertisements geared towards men. 
I dont care that these girls are modelling, they all look amazing. 
I care about the functionality of the bra. 
not poses in an entirely white room... i want to know how comfy this bra gonna be, do it got clasps? do it got wires that are going to jab in my ribs if I dance like them? 
I dont give a shit about your contour Falicia! am I gone get a wedgie when I twerk??","VS"
"So sexy 💞","VS"
"when are the see through bras coming out ? anytime soon, trying to get one for my side hoe","VS"
"elsa's eyes!","VS"
"Elsa is life.","VS"
"Stella is hot hot hot.. Accept it.. Give her a chance..","VS"
"Watch, one day these new angles are going to be everyone's favorite. And they won't want them to leave lol. This hate or whatever probaly happened to Candice, Behati, Lily, etc. a long time ago. Hopefully some people will get use to them soon😊","VS"
"Stella and Elsa have way too much make up on, whereas Lais looks natural.
Plus some of the patterns look like grandma underwear like someone else mentioned in the comments. 
It looks stupid when you have casual/ normal underwear that's presented in a sexy manner. It doesn't make sense and looks pretentious. It would've been much better if you did something similar to ""Victoria's Secret presents a sexy short: Lily Aldridge""
It was funny, realistic, looked genuine and overall much more appealing for a casual/ normal style lingerie than this commercial.","VS"
"Elsa and the FantasyBra👌♥♥","VS"
"Elsa is drop-dead gorgeous! But, who the heck put Lais in that video??? Jasmine instead, please! And most importantly, they forgot Taylor. Taylor is best new angel, love her!","VS"
"Glad they're using Lais, she deserves it!","VS"
"its the same song they used in bralette commercial. 0 creativity 😐","VS"
"I remember when a Victoria's Secret commercial came on and I saw how amazing their bodies were. I then changed my whole lifestyle and I've been eating the healthiest I ever have. I got toned and I'm soo close to getting their body type. I was already skinny but not toned. People say Victoria's Secret is bad for young girls because it ""causes eating disorders"" but I disagree, it encouraged me to be super healthy and fit. I really need that inspiration, so thank you soo much Victoria's Secret!","VS"
"Now that Candy and Behati are on leave expecting their babies and the veteran Angels are moving on the only girls I care about are Elsa and Taylor","VS"
"How do I get a stomach and waist like this asap?","VS"
"I hate it when people talk shit about new models and state that the old ones were better. I mean... things change: models get old, they quit, start their families, have kids, start acting, travelling, enjoying life... Give new girls a chance. I am not a Stella fan at the moment, she's not the bast talker but her pics are great. Some haters remind me of my grandfather saying: ""cars nowadays are not what they used to be... they were pure metal and wood... now they use plastic"". Well, things evolve and sometimes it's hard to tolerate change.","VS"
"Elsa <3. I remember when she used to be that beautiful blonde who was always chosen to be in the ""PINK"" segment for the annual VS fashion show. It took longer than it should have but I'm glad she has come so far.","VS"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE","VS"
"Elsa is drop dead gorgeous!","VS"

"I'm trying to like the new angels but i can't. maybe the vibes and the power of the older angels are too strong... i don't really see what this new angels will bring in the future.. but the old one definitely much much better! they are uncomparable","VS"
"Honestly victoria secret is irrelevant now.. :/","VS"
"Bom tarde é obrigado pelo maravilhoso vídeo","VS"
"You guys candice and Behati are pregnant so thats why their not in the ads anymore! I dont know why they don't use Adriana anymore . But i do know that alessandra contract only require her to do the fashion show , (hope this helps a little)","VS"

"Not a big fan of her beauty, but  when they were introducing new angels she was considered as the worst one, now she's better than some of them.

"I see the wings in the bag","VS"
"Fantastic 😻","VS"
"Candice is next lvl beauty and angel","VS"
"wow。。。。。","VS"
"Does anyone know how to attend the show? I live in Paris but I have no idea what I have to do to be part of the audience.","VS"
"Sad Candice won't be there, Ughh anything they put on her is like magical. I remember when she got to wear all the bathing suits in their catalog and I wanted to buy every single one that she was wearing. You know Candice is a goddess, she is a rarety.","VS"
"Candice is not there because she has just cave i think","VS"
"i'm just happy that Liu Wen will be in this. Because looking at some of the girls chosen makes me sad","VS"
"It seems that you have been bought ed, The vsfs is losing all credibility by placing models like Kendall and Gigi to walk on the mark, It seems that the audience of the show this year will be worse than the audience of the show last year.
Nobody wants to see Kendall Jenner walking to the VSFS2016, Gigi and Kendall don't deserve to be in the VSFS. Unlike Kendall and Gigi Hundreds of models work hard all year to get a spot in the VSFS. Kendall and Gigi are where they are because they were already rich and famous this is called nepotism, I'm tired to see everyone paying attention to Kendall and Gigi just because they are beautiful and famous, they have no talent several other models that work hard (for example Jourdan Dunn, Nadine Leopold, Lauren de Graaf, Shanina Shaik) do not receive the recognition they deserve. The only thing that Kendall, Gigi have contributed to fashion is elitism and nepotism.","VS"
"who wanna perform this year?","VS"

(No hate pls I'm from Paris)","VS"

"FIFTH HARMONY SHOULD PERFORM!!!","VS"
"FIFTH HARMONY SHOULD PERFORM!!!","VS"
"CUANDO ES EL DESFILE.????","VS"
"I am so glad that Behati will not be on this year show. She cheapens the show with her childish, trashy and immature antics, this show is for sexy, sensual, reserved BOMBSHELLS, not for a attention whore who ruined two openings and just sticks her tongue out like some desperate teen girl. I could forgive all of that, if she at least looks good, but she is the worst looking angel, with the worst looking body in the world, in golden era of VS she wouldn't be allowed to even bring coffee to the goddesses like Adriana, Candice and Gisele. Standards of beauty are all time low if she with those awful teeth, small pigish eyes, huge jaw, huge ears and smile like a Joker can be in this show. And her body is the worst body type ever, so called skinny fat, she is skinny, but without any curve, untoned body, flat but, and beer belly.","VS"

"It seems that you have been bought ed, The vsfs is losing all credibility by placing models like Kendall and Gigi to walk on the mark, It seems that the audience of the show this year will be worse than the audience of the show last year.
Nobody wants to see Kendall Jenner walking to the VSFS2016, Gigi and Kendall don't deserve to be in the VSFS. Unlike Kendall and Gigi Hundreds of models work hard all year to get a spot in the VSFS. Kendall and Gigi are where they are because they were already rich and famous this is called nepotism, I'm tired to see everyone paying attention to Kendall and Gigi just because they are beautiful and famous, they have no talent several other models that work hard (for example Jourdan Dunn, Nadine Leopold, Lauren de Graaf, Shanina Shaik) do not receive the recognition they deserve. The only thing that Kendall, Gigi have contributed to fashion is elitism and nepotism.","VS"

She cheapens the show with her childish, trashy and immature antics, this show is for sexy, sensual, reserved BOMBSHELLS, not for a attention whore who ruined two openings and just sticks her tongue out like some desperate teen girl. I could forgive all of that, if she at least looks good, but she is the worst looking angel, with the worst looking body in the world, in golden era of VS she wouldn't be allowed to even bring coffee to the goddesses like Adriana, Candice and Gisele. Standards of beauty are all time low if she with those awful teeth, small pigish eyes, huge jaw, huge ears and smile like a Joker can be in this show. And her body is the worst body type ever, so called skinny fat, she is skinny, but without any curve, untoned body, flat but, and beer belly.","VS"

Dangerous Woman was literally created for the VS Fashion Show and if Ariana doesn't perform I'm suing. Gaga's old stuff like Paparazzi and Bad Romance  would work as well but I'm assuming she's going to do ""The Road Ahead"" since Joanne's country vibe would fit well with it.","VS"

"Cant imagine how this gonna be without candice and behati :(","VS"
"Good for them to bring back Karlie especially that the show will be on Paris which Karlie does couture shows a lot- like really A LOT!","VS"
"The segments seem to be amazing, I just can't wait, so excited!! Also, it would be truly amazing to work with such a big production, just think of all the hard work they put into it, and then they see it all come alive in such incredible way. I would love to be a part of making the VS fashion show!#justsaying

ALSO, I think the Pink Nation should have Fifth Harmony performing with ""That's my girl"". I think it would really fit!","VS"
"post part 2","VS"
"When are they going to add Plus size models? Its really about time they do so ,we need plus size models on the runway too.","VS"
"GINA","VS"
"I feel like this is gonna be a great show (better than last years) but I don't want so skinny models in the show cause it's weird! I would like the models to be like the previous ones the 'golden era' they just keep getting skinnier every time...","VS"
"Praying for a good show. Last year was a mess.","VS"
"They've chosen such useless models this year, they better have Allesandra and Adriana to clean up the mess.","VS"
"Secret angel and dark angel are practically the same.....","VS"
"Im still mad Doutzen never got the fantasy bra!  :(","VS"
"road ahead seems like exotic traveller, secret angel and dark angel seem similar to angel ball. Pink nation souns very repetitive by the name of it and idk about mountain romance and bright night angel","VS"
"I can't wait to see this","VS"
"I really hope to see more black models this year in the Victoria Secret Fashion Show","VS"
"I dont like when VS brings models in like Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid, pretty much downgrades the show","VS"
"I wanna see Sia performing this time for VS!","VS"
"i want zayn","VS"
"VSFS lost it's class","VS"
"looking forward to seeing VANESSA AXENTE on this!","VS"
"Give Behati a fantasy bra!!!!!! Ik she's not walking this year but you guys need to honor her, she's always been looked over","VS"
"Love the way the sketches look","VS"
"Since they are holding the Victoria's Secret Fashion show here in Paris. Can they finally open a shop here!","VS"
"VS is already corrupted. This and last year's show just goes to prove it. Kendall? Bella? Everyone knows they have no skill in comparison to the other models. Start listening to your fans while you still have them, VS...maybe start making ALL models do casting, then you'll get true talent.","VS"
"i wnt my Brazilians Top Models opening This show pleeeeeaaasseeee Alessandra and Adriana Brazil eveerrrrrr","VS"
"Does anyone know who's going to sing this year?","VS"

"3:21 is that the dress for Kendall?","VS"
"I see the same segment with new names (old shows: Country girls, Angel Ball, Exotic Traveller and Silver Screen Angel), but well. I truly hope the outfits will outshine last year's. The Grand Palais is a beautiful location and I'm looking forward to seeing it. Fab!","VS"
"They can't keep the old girls forever. They will bring in Bella, Gigi and Kendall because they have a huge following with the 12-18 market which is a billions of dollar a year market.","VS"
"These ideas have been done before..","VS"
"I liked the idea of doing it during the day considered the space they are using :)","VS"
"Wish I worked there","VS"
"Victoria secret chose Gigi, Kendall and Bella, God this show is gonna suck.","VS"
"Wait the theme ""costumes"" this year are not so-creative / new. Sad","VS"
"BRING MIRANDA KERR BACK!!!","VS"
"Candice gave birth already, maybe she is not bouncing back to her body as fast as Adriana, Alessandra and Heidi did! I just hope that Adriana Lima opens the show and wears more than 2 outfits, she is a true exotic beauty, non like the other girls that are mehhhh!","VS"
"I hope kendall jenner is there this time just as gigi hadid","VS"

"I have an idea about next years fantasy bra. Next year is going to be 40 years VS. This is really special, so the fantasy bra should be and be worn special. I just thought: even not the most expensive bra, the Royal of Candice, was 10 millions worth. There are actually so many angels, and what would be even more amazing, models like Izabel, Lily Donaldson or Maria Borges, who really did so much for VS, who would deserve to wear the Fantasy Bra. So at the end, there are like 10 angels and models who really would deserve this. So I thought that you could do one segment only composed of Fantasy Bras, each angel or model wearing one worth around 1 million. It would have the same cost as the one of Candice and would be really history making. Dear VS, please think about it. (And all reading this, please give me a like, so VS is going to see this).","VS"
"The girls hugged her like they were in elementry school lol","VS"

"yay! go Jazzy! so well deserved. i'm really hoping that next year they will pick one from some of the girls who have been in the vs for quite some time now. Don't know if I'd be too happy if Kendall, Gigi or Bella gets it seeing that they've only started. They seem to be getting everything other girls get years down the line tbh","VS"

"Such a beautiful girl!! Im glad they have finally picked her! love her skin! I agree with the other comments, Sara, Taylor, Elsa and Lais are the only ones who do have VS material. I would kick Stella, Martha and the rest of the new angels out because they look so alike and I think VS needs more diversity... too many blondes lately! and none of them can compare to Candice, Behati, Adriana, Alessandra or Lily. I miss Miranda, Doutzen and Rossie :(","VS"

"I am really happy that she got this year's fantasy bra. But at the same time, I wished Ale get the fantasy bra... cuz I think she is the most underrated angel in VS and she should get more fantasy bra as the same as Adriana..","VS"
"Honestly, I don't like Jasmine, but she deserves it anyways because she works very hard to promote the brand this year.","VS"
"LAIS should be the new angel who gets it. She has been working for the brand since 2010. Why did VS just hand it to these newbies where there is another who has been working with them very hard for so many years. They should honour the new angel who has been working with them for so long. SMH. VS really screwed up with their choice for this year. Next year, BEHATI must wear the fantasy bra or they'll be screwing up for next year as well.","VS"

It would have the same cost as the one of Candice and would be really history making. Dear VS, please think about it. (And all reading this, please give me a like, so VS is going to see this).","VS"
"The girls hugged her like they were in elementry school lol","VS"
"My hopes for the next 4 fantasy bras. 2017, Behati. 2018, Lais. 2019, Elsa. 2020, Sara Sampaio","VS"
"Love watching these racist haters cry their bitter tears over this. Stop being so damn transparent. Every model these haters suggest should replace her is white. Get over it people. Jasmine has been working for VS for a long time. She deserves this.","VS"
"do vs models get to keep the fantasy bra?","VS"
"I will shit myself if Behati / Lais / Elsa doesn't get the fb next year, I mean come on VS really??? give it to the newbie ??? Happy for Jasmine though :))","VS"
"Taylor 😍😍","VS"
"yay! go Jazzy! so well deserved. i'm really hoping that next year they will pick one from some of the girls who have been in the vs for quite some time now. Don't know if I'd be too happy if Kendall, Gigi or Bella gets it seeing that they've only started. They seem to be getting everything other girls get years down the line tbh","VS"
"Yasss Queen!  well deserved! I love everything about her! Slay that runway#","VS"
"Congratulations. but I want Behati","VS"
"Taylor is so fake","VS"
"she is gorgeous, but she looks short compared to the other girls","VS"
"Those girls are screaming like babies","VS"
"still waiting for Behati to get her shining moment, a moment she so deserves in her fantasy bra.","VS"
"Such a beautiful girl!! Im glad they have finally picked her! love her skin! I agree with the other comments, Sara, Taylor, Elsa and Lais are the only ones who do have VS material. I would kick Stella, Martha and the rest of the new angels out because they look so alike and I think VS needs more diversity... too many blondes lately! and none of them can compare to Candice, Behati, Adriana, Alessandra or Lily. I miss Miranda, Doutzen and Rossie :(","VS"
"*people should stop falling for these type of girls they're no good they're  full of junk*","VS"
"yes YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS OMG YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS JASMINE","VS"
"no behati this year  ???    :(   :(","VS"
"Taylor Hill is the definition of BEST FRIEND GOALS!! and congratz Jazzzzz !!! 💋💋💋❤❤❤","VS"
"Lais Ribeiro deserves it more.","VS"
"Because she's black you can't say that she doesn't deserve it otherwise you gonna be called racist even if she was a Jenner or a hadid You can't say she doesn't deserve it cuz she's black!","VS"
"Doutzen never got the fantasy bra! :(","VS"
"I was hoping for elsa or lais, but Jasmine seems so sweet, I'm happy for her.","VS"
"paris, omg. I knew they would have their fashion show their one day.","VS"
"hope that bee will be wearing next year's fantasy bra. jasmine would be wonderful this year.","VS"
"finally a beautiful black woman like Jasmine gets the bra! so happy for her she really deserves it can't wait to watch the show.","VS"
"Good for her","VS"
"sara should have it next","VS"
"No way!","VS"
"I'm so happy for her!!!!","VS"
"she's very pretty.","VS"
"Aww congrats doll proud of you girl xoxo","VS"
"best thing EVER ! of course I want behati for a fantasy bra but , jasmine was such a good choice , i want elsa , and jojo to wear a future FB ❤ I love jojo romee and tay screaming and hear ""we love you"" to jas ❤ that was so sweet","VS"
"❤️❤️","VS"
"It's not because she's black. She deserved it.","VS"
"<3","VS"
"I'm shook, why? There are bettter Angels that had been there for YEARS... Actually some of them left the show before wearing the Fantasy bra. This is unfair 😤","VS"
"Miranda Kerr will still by my #1 angel of all time ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️","VS"
"I just love that Jasmine got it, she is so so cute and hardworking model. Waiting for the rest of the models, since Be and Candice are not walking is gonna be def a huge emptiness but still is an opportunity for new models. Glad Lili is walking and Gigi got it this year again :D, so the angels do not have to do casting right?","VS"
"Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
They picked Jasmine?! I love this girl but I think Behati deserves the fantasy bra. 
I just confused.","VS"
"So I am happy and pleased with this news. Jas is so beautiful, special, friendly and works hard all year .. She deserves a lot. Glad to have a black woman so fantastic occupying this position of iconic women .. This is fantastic, a dream. Jas, the light guide you on the catwalk. God bless you","VS"
"0:35 so cute :-)","VS"
"alguém traduz esse negócio pra mim???🤔🤔","VS"
"I love jasmine but I think she got her skin bleached because she was not that light.😍","VS"
"She should open the show wearing it.","VS"
"Ok guys, dont you understand that it is rude to keep saying that another angel should have gotten the FB when they have revealed it will be Jasmine? The fact that she might not be your fave doesnt mean that she doesnt deserve to get it.","VS"
"I am really happy that she got this year's fantasy bra. But at the same time, I wished Ale get the fantasy bra... cuz I think she is the most underrated angel in VS and she should get more fantasy bra as the same as Adriana..","VS"
"Honestly, I don't like Jasmine, but she deserves it anyways because she works very hard to promote the brand this year.","VS"
"LAIS should be the new angel who gets it. She has been working for the brand since 2010. Why did VS just hand it to these newbies where there is another who has been working with them very hard for so many years. They should honour the new angel who has been working with them for so long. SMH. VS really screwed up with their choice for this year. Next year, BEHATI must wear the fantasy bra or they'll be screwing up for next year as well.","VS"
"I Hope next year taylor will wear it","VS"
"i wish i could wear that bra","VS"
"she is way to skinny","VS"
"she is so gorgeous","VS"
"I'm so proud !!👏🏼❤️jasmine deserved it","VS"
"I hope Behati wears the FBI next year","VS"
"Let me just ask vs one question, why is it not Lais? Obviously lais is more experienced than her. Don't tell me is because the influence on gram or snap","VS"
"People keep saying that Behati deserved to get the FB bra this year and I'm just like?! Wtf she just had her baby a month ago, you really expect her to wear it this year when she wasn't even in shape for the fitting? Also Lais shouldn't have got it because she's boring, her facial expressions and personality are boring. Congrats to Jas I'm happy to see another black model after Tyra get the FB bra.","VS"
"The best part was when taylor romee and jo came to hug her. Shows genuine friendship ❤️","VS"
"Muito anor por Jasmine","VS"
"here I was thinking Elsa or Lais got FB this year since they have been on the show more than other girls havve","VS"
"OH MY GOD!!! I screamed when I saw this!!! So happy for her!!","VS"
"Behati now is like the new Alessandra, she had to wait twelve years to get the bra... I know it is because of her little baby but last year Lily who came two years after Bee got it... However Jasmine is pretty beautiful and she was the best choice","VS"
"I like Jasmine, but I thing that bra deserved one of the old angels...","VS"
"what!!!! I like her but Lais had to wear the fantasy bra !! or maybe  Elsa 😐😒","VS"
"After Selita finally a black Angel. And next year Behati in The Fantasy Bra! Love Jasmine","VS"
"I'm thrilled to see her get the fb but the actual bra is kinda underwhelming this year tbh.","VS"
"@Jastookes perfeita deusa rainha","VS"
"I truly miss the old angels - this ""new"" faces are just younger copies of the old girls and they cant fit in their shoes","VS"
"poor my Doutzen....","VS"
"she is georgeous","VS"
"Two questions: is Elsa walking the show this year? Is she only walking one time on the show or more? Shes my fave❤️","VS"
"so proud of you my angel ❤🌸🙈","VS"
"I've always said she was an underrated black model and then this happens! Wow as much as I love laid and Elsa who've been around longer and deserve it I am so happy for jasmine! I was screaming for her!!","VS"
"YAAAASSSSS IM SO HAPPY FOR JASMINE WELL DESERVED","VS"
"Disappointed. I'm not hating. I love Jasmine but I think Lais really deserves it or Izabel Goulart at least.... Really...","VS"
"Bella is beautiful here. She's beautiful with this face rather than heavy bold-makeup i usually see in that magazine cover","VS"
"She's ugly af","VS"
"Wait, they sell a spot now?","VS"
"Why are people so rude, please she’s a human","VS"
"She walks very well","VS"
"she only got it for her name lol","VS"
"everyone knows, Victoria's secret has been struggling since the mid 2000's to keep relevance, 

they perpetuated Tyra Banks/Naomi Campbell drama for ratings in 2005, ( by editing Naomi's reaction to Tyra's last runway)

also, they lost most of their major iconic models from 2005-2007, they lost Tyra, Naomi, Giselle - so they were forced to make more buzz. . . remember Marisa Miller getting to wear the fantasy bra!?! when she was on maxim hot 100, and sports illustrated that year? to create buzz,

now since 2016, they've lost Miranda, Candice, Doutzen, Karlie, Heidi - so no wonder they're using reality show models. . .

can't blame them- - they've been doing this for years","VS"
"worst one ever!!","VS"
"c´mon girl...... she already knew she was in... don´t play dumb. the casting was just a formality","VS"
"They're other models who join VS but u didn't make videos about them.","VS"
"man y'all are some truly jealous, bitter people aren't you? the hadid girls are stunning, get over your petty hatred and love yourself lmfao.","VS"
"She's so fake!","VS"
"bella gostosaaaaaaaaaaaa congrats","VS"
"nice bella","VS"
"She's fucking cute","VS"
"I can't anymore. ","VS"
"She's so cutee","VS"
"#bellahadid = #love. ❤❤❤","VS"
"Victoria Secret 2016 is COMPLETE FAILURE","VS"
"See the title. Cough. Dislike. Leave.","VS"
"Omg her hip bones","VS"
"Lets be blunt mate, that was no casting, you were in cos your last name is hadid. You could have started fingering yourself during the cast and you would still have made it.","VS"
"Why did basically 90% of the people commenting here just come to hate? Pretty pathetic really","VS"
"who's next? Kylie Jenner, Hailey Baldwin or Sofia Richie? Lmao no","VS"
"I didn't like her before but now I do. She looks so different from all those swet&sexy vs models.","VS"
"all these ""wannabe models"" are making VS show go down, srsly I only watch it because of Adriana, Alessandra and Lily. :(","VS"
"Bella isn't right for victoria secert fashion show.","VS"
"Ugh... Why are Kendall and the Hadids in the fashion show... Most of the models there came from nothing and worked their asses off, when these three got there cuz their parents are rich. Wtf?","VS"
"She is not even pretty","VS"
"Her walk was terrible","VS"
"Now im just waiting for Mr. Bean to show up on the runway next year...","VS"
"how are they sooo skinny yet has such a nice ass??! I need to know their secret!!!","VS"
"This could be a joke .Yeah bad joke !","VS"
"THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE!!! VICTORIAS SECRET should give a chance for model with real potentials.","VS"
"It's not all about the walk. You need to have a specific aura. Everyone can walk down a runway, but not everyone can do it while looking comfortable and affecting the audience in a good way.
Yeah, there's people who have been working hard, but sometimes you can never achieve something and you have to realise that, so that you can focus on something else and give 200% doing that.
It sucks to hear, I know, but some people are born with it, and some people have to learn it. And learning always takes decades to master.","VS"
"I wonder what would happen if they hired singers (above 170 cm) like Rihanna and Taylor Swift to walk as VS models...","VS"
"She should not be there and neither should Gigi or Kendall. Not saying they aren't pretty enough but they all lack personality and their walks are terrible for VS. This was obviously planned and it is bullshit Bella does not have the personality or confidence Victoria's secret models exudes she seems so timid and awkward and nervous all the time and it showed in her walk. She does not even have a sexy bombshell look she has a more of a unique high fashion look but she's not VS material. I think this is my last year watching this show.","VS"
"I didn't expect her to be adorable too.","VS"
"Bella is a special lady! But i'am pretty sure that VS picked her just because The Weeknd was going to perform. They wanted to have some ratings not just because Bella already has way more fame than many other girls that are way gorgeous than her, but also they knew that two famous exes on one stage when one of them is wearing underwear will keep so many people  next to their TV. Well planed and and in fact really worked ! In today's world PR is the only thing that sales something and this brand is in the industry long enough to know that. End of story","VS"
"Go for her !! Hot and sexy as Gigi 👍😉","VS"
"ewwww figure!  not fit for modelling","VS"
"Bella,you have no talent for this job.Just accept it.You looked out of place,you looked lost and miserable. Besides,you are too skinny.","VS"
"She looks like 30 something.","VS"
"Why are there clips and pictures from the VS show 2016 it's on the 5th 12 2016?! Did i miss it????????","VS"
"I mean, they can be in the show, but they have to work hard for it. not enter the show without castings.  that's just plain stupid","VS"
"this literally puts adriana and the other models who worked hard to shame","VS"
"if you put them in you might as well not make those inspiring vids about the original vs models cuz putting the hadids in or kendall ruins the whole ""work your way to the top"" vibe","VS"
"might as well put all the kardashians then. boom. the cherry on top","VS"
"they're acting all like ""oh my God did I get it, didn't I get it?"" bitch, like there was a chance they wouldn't want to get money from your rich ass.","VS"
"She is NoT a fit for VS","VS"
"she's ugly af","VS"
"yeah.....wait till her ex performs on the ramp.....","VS"
"A lot of jealous people in the comments section, my God... Why can't you just be happy for someone, for once? Does it really matter that she didn't have to ""work as hard"" as some other girls?","VS"
"This makes me feel some type of way I have no hate towards Bella but all the other models work there butt off and these celebrity's there putting in here only got it because their family cause if Bella walk in their all cricket they would give her another chance because they don't want vs to look bad.  I believe In hard work Kendall does everything for Calvin underwear and other models work harder than her why did she just get it because of her sister","VS"
"Kendall Gender Jenner takes a lot away from this industry. Like fuckin gag! The other models are drop dead gorgeous...wtf I suggest everyone who hates these kartrashians boycott Victoria's Secret!","VS"
"many motherfuckers are jealous of Bella's achievement 😂😂 go fuck yourself you bloody motherfuckers! work hard and achieve something instead of talking bad about this beautiful talented angel","VS"
"Bella Hadid is actually a great model who has done sooooo good in high fashion modeling. Gigi overshadows her so much which sucks bc Bella has actually worked more harder than Gigi in the sense that Gigi rose to fame for being best friends w Kendall, n dating Zayn. Plus bella fits well bc she has such strong characteristics.","VS"
"Sadly we all have to accept the fact that nepotism exists in all industries. Yes, she might have worked very hard but compared to those models w/o background or a multi billionaire dad and famous mother, she did rly little. It is her background that allowed her to walk on the most anticipated runway and appear on billboards wearing high end fashion products. That cannot be denied.","VS"
"Jourdan Dunn didn't walk in 2015 so guess what happened Rihanna was SUPPOSED to be performing but dropped out because Jourdan Dunn wasn't walking because Kendall REPLACED Jourdan even when Kendall didn't go to a casting","VS"
"no, no, no, no! Gigi was, now Bella? Was Kendall, Kylie is now?","VS"
"why cant anyone be happy for her stop being so negative dang","VS"
"i am not happy to see you like this ...","VS"
"I love Bella and I'm so exited to c where her career is headed but
I just find it a bit unfair to be honest how nowadays social media plays such a huge role on the casting of models that's just my opinion tho and don't mean to offend anyone","VS"
"Yeah and next year select Kim kardashian and give her the fantasy bra . For fucks sake take some help from your previous fashion shows and see how the models were back then","VS"
"So happy for Bella ❤️","VS"
"Wtf she is not pretty her and her sister don't fit the mold of a vs model","VS"
"To everyone who thinks that Bella didn't deserve to be in the fashion show or she's the reason it's going to be ruined FU. I mean everyone has the right to an opinion but remember there's a person just like u behind that screen nd guess what, no matter what u say the people who casted her think she's grt nd so do many others, including me. I'm pretty sure none of us r fortune tellers so let's just wait for the fashion show nd then give CONSTRUCTIVE criticism instead of tearing someone down. I think Bella's gonna do an amazing job nd I don't think anything was FED to her. Of course she has an advantage cause of her family but maybe they looked past that nd casted her for her. Also I'm pretty sure most u don't have the guts to walk in ur underwear as well she did in front of a camera nd other people so after u try out go hate on her but until then try to realize she's human too","VS"
"The Victoria's Secret Fashion show is not only a show but a business. They want to reach out to as much people as possible, and if hiring Bella, Gigi, Cara and Kendall, and probably Hailey soon, will get that visibility they want, to improve sales. Then they have a right to do so. I have no qualms against that.

I just wish girls from the Philippines and Venezuela, will be represented, as they are beauty pageant powerhouses. And girls from these countries are trained to be brand ambassadors. They are intelligent, eloquent and beautiful at the same. I also hope they would give a bonafide Angel contract to an Asian girl. Victoria's Secret fashion show is already good. But if what I mentioned happens. Victoria's Secret fashion show would be perfect =)","VS"
"she's 16? wtf...","VS"
"you cant start running down the runway ""!!!!!!","VS"
"I alway wonder, if only VS didn't cast Bela Hadid. There is going to be a girl who can fulfill her dreams walking in the runway. All of her hardwork going to the castings million times, years after years will be paid. But it's not happening. Her place is taken by Bela Hadid who got casted so damn easiy. And whoever that girl who should be in the runway, I wish her much brighter career, and you're going to be not only a great model but also a great person.","VS"
"OMG she's so cute😍😍😍","VS"
"Am I the only one who doesn't find her particularly pretty....? She's just not on the level of a vs model. And also, her hips sit a bit too high in proportion to the other girls who are normally cast","VS"
"She is cute","VS"
"VS is going down hill wtf","VS"
"She is not ugly or anything but damn... it's clear that she didn't do much to be there. I can't understand why stunning girls like Sara Sampaio were only acepted in the third try to and this average looking girl makes it to the show just because of her name.","VS"
"lol Vs is such a joke nowadays","VS"
"the show is getting worst","VS"
"hate as much as u want guys but bella's look is perfect for vs, unlike other way too skinny girls who are casted, she has curves (a kind of bombshell look which is what vs always stood for) ps; sorry for my english","VS"
"eeewww no. it might be the worst show of the year yet. i can't wait for CANDICE to be back","VS"
"I like Bella but having all 3 is too much they should remove Gigi or Kendall.","VS"
"shes the love of my life","VS"
"Sometimes in selling products you need the most popular one not the best one to endorse your products.","VS"
"THE GOLDEN AGES OF VS HAS ENDED","VS"
"I'm not a fan of Gigi or Kendall but Bella has one hell of a body","VS"
"So many better models and they pick the worst ...","VS"
"I like Bella, she´s a great model and be on the VS fashion show was one of her dreams, and she auditioned and got it so why you people hate on her, she deserve it she did a lot to be an angel. So why u hate? Just bc u r jealous or what?","VS"
"what a woman...","VS"
"I think all of her face surgeries helped her right...","VS"
"shes sooo sweet and cute","VS"
"YAY I LOVE BELLA I like how compared to the other castings I've seen she isn't so dead looking and actually has a body","VS"
"she only got accepted because of who she issss!!! I mean come on, is she for real? "" I'm not sure how it went..."" my ass she fucking knew she was going to get to model for them before she auditioned","VS"
"I love Bella in general but I really don't feel as if she's fit to model for the vs show","VS"
"so everyone is saying that Bella is walking for VS just because of her name, just like Gigi and Kendall, but you can't deny that she has an amazing body and that she works extremely hard to get it. All of you are complaining that she is only in VS because of her famous family and stuff, but why does it really matter? She didn't choose her family... her dream is to be a successful model and if she has a famous family it's not her problem... all that she achieves in her life is attributed to having a famous family but if she wants to be a model it's her choice. Otherwise, all the people with famous parents would not be able to be actors, singers or models, because everyone would think that they are successful only because of their parents and that's not fair for them. People have dreams, and I'm sure that if Bella didn't have a good body she wouldn't have made it to the show despite having a famous family. 
Yes, a lot of girls deserve to be here, but that doesn't mean that you have to hate on her, because she didn't choose herself, it was the producer.","VS"
"lol these ""castings"" with instagram models are so staged","VS"
"Of course she gets a video made for her 🙄 what about the 12 other models who are walking vs for the first time?","VS"
"why is everyone hating. lets just watch to see if the hadid sister and kendall are good this year or even if the show is good","VS"
"Is she Gigi Hadid's mom?","VS"
"Ok, not being rude but... she looks a lot like Ted Cruz.","VS"
"Money rules!","VS"
"Bella is beautiful here. She's beautiful with this face rather than heavy bold-makeup i usually see in that magazine cover","VS"
"She's ugly af","VS"

"Sadly we all have to accept the fact that nepotism exists in all industries. Yes, she might have worked very hard but compared to those models w/o background or a multi billionaire dad and famous mother, she did rly little. It is her background that allowed her to walk on the most anticipated runway and appear on billboards wearing high end fashion products. That cannot be denied.","VS"
"Jourdan Dunn didn't walk in 2015 so guess what happened Rihanna was SUPPOSED to be performing but dropped out because Jourdan Dunn wasn't walking because Kendall REPLACED Jourdan even when Kendall didn't go to a casting","VS"
"no, no, no, no! Gigi was, now Bella? Was Kendall, Kylie is now?","VS"
"why cant anyone be happy for her stop being so negative dang","VS"
"i am not happy to see you like this ...","VS"
"I love Bella and I'm so exited to c where her career is headed but
I just find it a bit unfair to be honest how nowadays social media plays such a huge role on the casting of models that's just my opinion tho and don't mean to offend anyone","VS"
"Yeah and next year select Kim kardashian and give her the fantasy bra . For fucks sake take some help from your previous fashion shows and see how the models were back then","VS"
"So happy for Bella ❤️","VS"
"Wtf she is not pretty her and her sister don't fit the mold of a vs model","VS"
"To everyone who thinks that Bella didn't deserve to be in the fashion show or she's the reason it's going to be ruined FU. I mean everyone has the right to an opinion but remember there's a person just like u behind that screen nd guess what, no matter what u say the people who casted her think she's grt nd so do many others, including me. I'm pretty sure none of us r fortune tellers so let's just wait for the fashion show nd then give CONSTRUCTIVE criticism instead of tearing someone down. I think Bella's gonna do an amazing job nd I don't think anything was FED to her. Of course she has an advantage cause of her family but maybe they looked past that nd casted her for her. Also I'm pretty sure most u don't have the guts to walk in ur underwear as well she did in front of a camera nd other people so after u try out go hate on her but until then try to realize she's human too","VS"
"The Victoria's Secret Fashion show is not only a show but a business. They want to reach out to as much people as possible, and if hiring Bella, Gigi, Cara and Kendall, and probably Hailey soon, will get that visibility they want, to improve sales. Then they have a right to do so. I have no qualms against that.

I just wish girls from the Philippines and Venezuela, will be represented, as they are beauty pageant powerhouses. And girls from these countries are trained to be brand ambassadors. They are intelligent, eloquent and beautiful at the same. I also hope they would give a bonafide Angel contract to an Asian girl. Victoria's Secret fashion show is already good. But if what I mentioned happens. Victoria's Secret fashion show would be perfect =)","VS"
"she's 16? wtf...","VS"
"you cant start running down the runway ""!!!!!!","VS"
"I alway wonder, if only VS didn't cast Bela Hadid. There is going to be a girl who can fulfill her dreams walking in the runway. All of her hardwork going to the castings million times, years after years will be paid. But it's not happening. Her place is taken by Bela Hadid who got casted so damn easiy. And whoever that girl who should be in the runway, I wish her much brighter career, and you're going to be not only a great model but also a great person.","VS"
"OMG she's so cute😍😍😍","VS"
"Am I the only one who doesn't find her particularly pretty....? She's just not on the level of a vs model. And also, her hips sit a bit too high in proportion to the other girls who are normally cast","VS"
"She is cute","VS"
"VS is going down hill wtf","VS"
"She is not ugly or anything but damn... it's clear that she didn't do much to be there. I can't understand why stunning girls like Sara Sampaio were only acepted in the third try to and this average looking girl makes it to the show just because of her name.","VS"
"lol Vs is such a joke nowadays","VS"
"the show is getting worst","VS"
"hate as much as u want guys but bella's look is perfect for vs, unlike other way too skinny girls who are casted, she has curves (a kind of bombshell look which is what vs always stood for) ps; sorry for my english","VS"
"eeewww no. it might be the worst show of the year yet. i can't wait for CANDICE to be back","VS"
"I like Bella but having all 3 is too much they should remove Gigi or Kendall.","VS"
"shes the love of my life","VS"
"Sometimes in selling products you need the most popular one not the best one to endorse your products.","VS"
"THE GOLDEN AGES OF VS HAS ENDED","VS"
"I'm not a fan of Gigi or Kendall but Bella has one hell of a body","VS"
"So many better models and they pick the worst ...","VS"
"I like Bella, she´s a great model and be on the VS fashion show was one of her dreams, and she auditioned and got it so why you people hate on her, she deserve it she did a lot to be an angel. So why u hate? Just bc u r jealous or what?","VS"
"what a woman...","VS"
"I think all of her face surgeries helped her right...","VS"
"shes sooo sweet and cute","VS"
"YAY I LOVE BELLA I like how compared to the other castings I've seen she isn't so dead looking and actually has a body","VS"
"she only got accepted because of who she issss!!! I mean come on, is she for real? "" I'm not sure how it went..."" my ass she fucking knew she was going to get to model for them before she auditioned","VS"
"I love Bella in general but I really don't feel as if she's fit to model for the vs show","VS"
"so everyone is saying that Bella is walking for VS just because of her name, just like Gigi and Kendall, but you can't deny that she has an amazing body and that she works extremely hard to get it. All of you are complaining that she is only in VS because of her famous family and stuff, but why does it really matter? She didn't choose her family... her dream is to be a successful model and if she has a famous family it's not her problem... all that she achieves in her life is attributed to having a famous family but if she wants to be a model it's her choice. Otherwise, all the people with famous parents would not be able to be actors, singers or models, because everyone would think that they are successful only because of their parents and that's not fair for them. People have dreams, and I'm sure that if Bella didn't have a good body she wouldn't have made it to the show despite having a famous family. 
Yes, a lot of girls deserve to be here, but that doesn't mean that you have to hate on her, because she didn't choose herself, it was the producer.","VS"
"lol these ""castings"" with instagram models are so staged","VS"
"Of course she gets a video made for her 🙄 what about the 12 other models who are walking vs for the first time?","VS"
"why is everyone hating. lets just watch to see if the hadid sister and kendall are good this year or even if the show is good","VS"
"Is she Gigi Hadid's mom?","VS"
"Ok, not being rude but... she looks a lot like Ted Cruz.","VS"
"Money rules!","VS"
"Bella is beautiful here. She's beautiful with this face rather than heavy bold-makeup i usually see in that magazine cover","VS"
"She's ugly af","VS"
"Wait, they sell a spot now?","VS"
"Why are people so rude, please she’s a human","VS"
"She walks very well","VS"
"she only got it for her name lol","VS"
"everyone knows, Victoria's secret has been struggling since the mid 2000's to keep relevance, 

they perpetuated Tyra Banks/Naomi Campbell drama for ratings in 2005, ( by editing Naomi's reaction to Tyra's last runway)

also, they lost most of their major iconic models from 2005-2007, they lost Tyra, Naomi, Giselle - so they were forced to make more buzz. . . remember Marisa Miller getting to wear the fantasy bra!?! when she was on maxim hot 100, and sports illustrated that year? to create buzz,

now since 2016, they've lost Miranda, Candice, Doutzen, Karlie, Heidi - so no wonder they're using reality show models. . .

can't blame them- - they've been doing this for years","VS"
"worst one ever!!","VS"
"c´mon girl...... she already knew she was in... don´t play dumb. the casting was just a formality","VS"
"They're other models who join VS but u didn't make videos about them.","VS"

"See the title. Cough. Dislike. Leave.","VS"
"Omg her hip bones","VS"
"Lets be blunt mate, that was no casting, you were in cos your last name is hadid. You could have started fingering yourself during the cast and you would still have made it.","VS"
"Why did basically 90% of the people commenting here just come to hate? Pretty pathetic really","VS"
"who's next? Kylie Jenner, Hailey Baldwin or Sofia Richie? Lmao no","VS"
"I didn't like her before but now I do. She looks so different from all those swet&sexy vs models.","VS"
"all these ""wannabe models"" are making VS show go down, srsly I only watch it because of Adriana, Alessandra and Lily. :(","VS"
"Bella isn't right for victoria secert fashion show.","VS"
"Ugh... Why are Kendall and the Hadids in the fashion show... Most of the models there came from nothing and worked their asses off, when these three got there cuz their parents are rich. Wtf?","VS"
"She is not even pretty","VS"
"Her walk was terrible","VS"
"Now im just waiting for Mr. Bean to show up on the runway next year...","VS"
"how are they sooo skinny yet has such a nice ass??! I need to know their secret!!!","VS"
"This could be a joke .Yeah bad joke !","VS"
"THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE!!! VICTORIAS SECRET should give a chance for model with real potentials.","VS"
"It's not all about the walk. You need to have a specific aura. Everyone can walk down a runway, but not everyone can do it while looking comfortable and affecting the audience in a good way.
Yeah, there's people who have been working hard, but sometimes you can never achieve something and you have to realise that, so that you can focus on something else and give 200% doing that.
It sucks to hear, I know, but some people are born with it, and some people have to learn it. And learning always takes decades to master.","VS"
"I wonder what would happen if they hired singers (above 170 cm) like Rihanna and Taylor Swift to walk as VS models...","VS"
"She should not be there and neither should Gigi or Kendall. Not saying they aren't pretty enough but they all lack personality and their walks are terrible for VS. This was obviously planned and it is bullshit Bella does not have the personality or confidence Victoria's secret models exudes she seems so timid and awkward and nervous all the time and it showed in her walk. She does not even have a sexy bombshell look she has a more of a unique high fashion look but she's not VS material. I think this is my last year watching this show.","VS"
"I didn't expect her to be adorable too.","VS"
"Bella is a special lady! But i'am pretty sure that VS picked her just because The Weeknd was going to perform. They wanted to have some ratings not just because Bella already has way more fame than many other girls that are way gorgeous than her, but also they knew that two famous exes on one stage when one of them is wearing underwear will keep so many people  next to their TV. Well planed and and in fact really worked ! In today's world PR is the only thing that sales something and this brand is in the industry long enough to know that. End of story","VS"
"Go for her !! Hot and sexy as Gigi 👍😉","VS"
"ewwww figure!  not fit for modelling","VS"
"Bella,you have no talent for this job.Just accept it.You looked out of place,you looked lost and miserable. Besides,you are too skinny.","VS"
"She looks like 30 something.","VS"
"Why are there clips and pictures from the VS show 2016 it's on the 5th 12 2016?! Did i miss it????????","VS"

"yeah.....wait till her ex performs on the ramp.....","VS"
"A lot of jealous people in the comments section, my God... Why can't you just be happy for someone, for once? Does it really matter that she didn't have to ""work as hard"" as some other girls?","VS"
"This makes me feel some type of way I have no hate towards Bella but all the other models work there butt off and these celebrity's there putting in here only got it because their family cause if Bella walk in their all cricket they would give her another chance because they don't want vs to look bad.  I believe In hard work Kendall does everything for Calvin underwear and other models work harder than her why did she just get it because of her sister","VS"

I mean everyone has the right to an opinion but remember there's a person just like u behind that screen nd guess what, no matter what u say the people who casted her think she's grt nd so do many others, including me. I'm pretty sure none of us r fortune tellers so let's just wait for the fashion show nd then give CONSTRUCTIVE criticism instead of tearing someone down. I think Bella's gonna do an amazing job nd I don't think anything was FED to her. Of course she has an advantage cause of her family but maybe they looked past that nd casted her for her. Also I'm pretty sure most u don't have the guts to walk in ur underwear as well she did in front of a camera nd other people so after u try out go hate on her but until then try to realize she's human too","VS"
"The Victoria's Secret Fashion show is not only a show but a business. They want to reach out to as much people as possible, and if hiring Bella, Gigi, Cara and Kendall, and probably Hailey soon, will get that visibility they want, to improve sales. Then they have a right to do so. I have no qualms against that.

I just wish girls from the Philippines and Venezuela, will be represented, as they are beauty pageant powerhouses. And girls from these countries are trained to be brand ambassadors. They are intelligent, eloquent and beautiful at the same. I also hope they would give a bonafide Angel contract to an Asian girl. Victoria's Secret fashion show is already good. But if what I mentioned happens. Victoria's Secret fashion show would be perfect =)","VS"
"she's 16? wtf...","VS"
"you cant start running down the runway ""!!!!!!","VS"
"I alway wonder, if only VS didn't cast Bela Hadid. There is going to be a girl who can fulfill her dreams walking in the runway. All of her hardwork going to the castings million times, years after years will be paid. But it's not happening. Her place is taken by Bela Hadid who got casted so damn easiy. And whoever that girl who should be in the runway, I wish her much brighter career, and you're going to be not only a great model but also a great person.","VS"
"OMG she's so cute😍😍😍","VS"
"Am I the only one who doesn't find her particularly pretty....? She's just not on the level of a vs model. And also, her hips sit a bit too high in proportion to the other girls who are normally cast","VS"
"She is cute","VS"
"VS is going down hill wtf","VS"
"She is not ugly or anything but damn... it's clear that she didn't do much to be there. I can't understand why stunning girls like Sara Sampaio were only acepted in the third try to and this average looking girl makes it to the show just because of her name.","VS"
"lol Vs is such a joke nowadays","VS"
"the show is getting worst","VS"
"hate as much as u want guys but bella's look is perfect for vs, unlike other way too skinny girls who are casted, she has curves (a kind of bombshell look which is what vs always stood for) ps; sorry for my english","VS"
"eeewww no. it might be the worst show of the year yet. i can't wait for CANDICE to be back","VS"
"I like Bella but having all 3 is too much they should remove Gigi or Kendall.","VS"
"shes the love of my life","VS"
"Sometimes in selling products you need the most popular one not the best one to endorse your products.","VS"
"THE GOLDEN AGES OF VS HAS ENDED","VS"
"I'm not a fan of Gigi or Kendall but Bella has one hell of a body","VS"
"So many better models and they pick the worst ...","VS"
"I like Bella, she´s a great model and be on the VS fashion show was one of her dreams, and she auditioned and got it so why you people hate on her, she deserve it she did a lot to be an angel. So why u hate? Just bc u r jealous or what?","VS"
"what a woman...","VS"
"I think all of her face surgeries helped her right...","VS"
"shes sooo sweet and cute","VS"
"YAY I LOVE BELLA I like how compared to the other castings I've seen she isn't so dead looking and actually has a body","VS"
"she only got accepted because of who she issss!!! I mean come on, is she for real? "" I'm not sure how it went..."" my ass she fucking knew she was going to get to model for them before she auditioned","VS"
"I love Bella in general but I really don't feel as if she's fit to model for the vs show","VS"
"so everyone is saying that Bella is walking for VS just because of her name, just like Gigi and Kendall, but you can't deny that she has an amazing body and that she works extremely hard to get it. All of you are complaining that she is only in VS because of her famous family and stuff, but why does it really matter? She didn't choose her family... her dream is to be a successful model and if she has a famous family it's not her problem... all that she achieves in her life is attributed to having a famous family but if she wants to be a model it's her choice. Otherwise, all the people with famous parents would not be able to be actors, singers or models, because everyone would think that they are successful only because of their parents and that's not fair for them. People have dreams, and I'm sure that if Bella didn't have a good body she wouldn't have made it to the show despite having a famous family. 
Yes, a lot of girls deserve to be here, but that doesn't mean that you have to hate on her, because she didn't choose herself, it was the producer.","VS"
"lol these ""castings"" with instagram models are so staged","VS"
"Of course she gets a video made for her 🙄 what about the 12 other models who are walking vs for the first time?","VS"
"why is everyone hating. lets just watch to see if the hadid sister and kendall are good this year or even if the show is good","VS"
"Is she Gigi Hadid's mom?","VS"
"Ok, not being rude but... she looks a lot like Ted Cruz.","VS"
"Money rules!","VS"
"Bella is beautiful here. She's beautiful with this face rather than heavy bold-makeup i usually see in that magazine cover","VS"
"She's ugly af","VS"
"Wait, they sell a spot now?","VS"
"Why are people so rude, please she’s a human","VS"
"She walks very well","VS"
"she only got it for her name lol","VS"
"everyone knows, Victoria's secret has been struggling since the mid 2000's to keep relevance, 

they perpetuated Tyra Banks/Naomi Campbell drama for ratings in 2005, ( by editing Naomi's reaction to Tyra's last runway)

also, they lost most of their major iconic models from 2005-2007, they lost Tyra, Naomi, Giselle - so they were forced to make more buzz. . . remember Marisa Miller getting to wear the fantasy bra!?! when she was on maxim hot 100, and sports illustrated that year? to create buzz,

now since 2016, they've lost Miranda, Candice, Doutzen, Karlie, Heidi - so no wonder they're using reality show models. . .

can't blame them- - they've been doing this for years","VS"
"worst one ever!!","VS"
"c´mon girl...... she already knew she was in... don´t play dumb. the casting was just a formality","VS"
"They're other models who join VS but u didn't make videos about them.","VS"
"man y'all are some truly jealous, bitter people aren't you? the hadid girls are stunning, get over your petty hatred and love yourself lmfao.","VS"
"She's so fake!","VS"
"bella gostosaaaaaaaaaaaa congrats","VS"
"nice bella","VS"
"She's fucking cute","VS"
"I can't anymore. ","VS"
"She's so cutee","VS"
"#bellahadid = #love. ❤❤❤","VS"
"Victoria Secret 2016 is COMPLETE FAILURE","VS"
"See the title. Cough. Dislike. Leave.","VS"
"Omg her hip bones","VS"
"Lets be blunt mate, that was no casting, you were in cos your last name is hadid. You could have started fingering yourself during the cast and you would still have made it.","VS"
"Why did basically 90% of the people commenting here just come to hate? Pretty pathetic really","VS"
"who's next? Kylie Jenner, Hailey Baldwin or Sofia Richie? Lmao no","VS"
"I didn't like her before but now I do. She looks so different from all those swet&sexy vs models.","VS"
"all these ""wannabe models"" are making VS show go down, srsly I only watch it because of Adriana, Alessandra and Lily. :(","VS"
"Bella isn't right for victoria secert fashion show.","VS"
"Ugh... Why are Kendall and the Hadids in the fashion show... Most of the models there came from nothing and worked their asses off, when these three got there cuz their parents are rich. Wtf?","VS"
"She is not even pretty","VS"
"Her walk was terrible","VS"
"Now im just waiting for Mr. Bean to show up on the runway next year...","VS"
"how are they sooo skinny yet has such a nice ass??! I need to know their secret!!!","VS"
"This could be a joke .Yeah bad joke !","VS"
"THIS IS A FUCKING JOKE!!! VICTORIAS SECRET should give a chance for model with real potentials.","VS"
"It's not all about the walk. You need to have a specific aura. Everyone can walk down a runway, but not everyone can do it while looking comfortable and affecting the audience in a good way.
Yeah, there's people who have been working hard, but sometimes you can never achieve something and you have to realise that, so that you can focus on something else and give 200% doing that.
It sucks to hear, I know, but some people are born with it, and some people have to learn it. And learning always takes decades to master.","VS"
"I wonder what would happen if they hired singers (above 170 cm) like Rihanna and Taylor Swift to walk as VS models...","VS"
"She should not be there and neither should Gigi or Kendall. Not saying they aren't pretty enough but they all lack personality and their walks are terrible for VS. This was obviously planned and it is bullshit Bella does not have the personality or confidence Victoria's secret models exudes she seems so timid and awkward and nervous all the time and it showed in her walk. She does not even have a sexy bombshell look she has a more of a unique high fashion look but she's not VS material. I think this is my last year watching this show.","VS"
"I didn't expect her to be adorable too.","VS"
"Bella is a special lady! But i'am pretty sure that VS picked her just because The Weeknd was going to perform. They wanted to have some ratings not just because Bella already has way more fame than many other girls that are way gorgeous than her, but also they knew that two famous exes on one stage when one of them is wearing underwear will keep so many people  next to their TV. Well planed and and in fact really worked ! In today's world PR is the only thing that sales something and this brand is in the industry long enough to know that. End of story","VS"
"Go for her !! Hot and sexy as Gigi 👍😉","VS"
"ewwww figure!  not fit for modelling","VS"
"Bella,you have no talent for this job.Just accept it.You looked out of place,you looked lost and miserable. Besides,you are too skinny.","VS"
"She looks like 30 something.","VS"
"Why are there clips and pictures from the VS show 2016 it's on the 5th 12 2016?! Did i miss it????????","VS"
"I mean, they can be in the show, but they have to work hard for it. not enter the show without castings.  that's just plain stupid","VS"
"this literally puts adriana and the other models who worked hard to shame","VS"
"if you put them in you might as well not make those inspiring vids about the original vs models cuz putting the hadids in or kendall ruins the whole ""work your way to the top"" vibe","VS"
"might as well put all the kardashians then. boom. the cherry on top","VS"
"they're acting all like ""oh my God did I get it, didn't I get it?"" bitch, like there was a chance they wouldn't want to get money from your rich ass.","VS"
"She is NoT a fit for VS","VS"
"she's ugly af","VS"
"yeah.....wait till her ex performs on the ramp.....","VS"
"A lot of jealous people in the comments section, my God... Why can't you just be happy for someone, for once? Does it really matter that she didn't have to ""work as hard"" as some other girls?","VS"
"This makes me feel some type of way I have no hate towards Bella but all the other models work there butt off and these celebrity's there putting in here only got it because their family cause if Bella walk in their all cricket they would give her another chance because they don't want vs to look bad.  I believe In hard work Kendall does everything for Calvin underwear and other models work harder than her why did she just get it because of her sister","VS"
"Kendall Gender Jenner takes a lot away from this industry. Like fuckin gag! The other models are drop dead gorgeous...wtf I suggest everyone who hates these kartrashians boycott Victoria's Secret!","VS"
"many motherfuckers are jealous of Bella's achievement 😂😂 go fuck yourself you bloody motherfuckers! work hard and achieve something instead of talking bad about this beautiful talented angel","VS"
"Bella Hadid is actually a great model who has done sooooo good in high fashion modeling. Gigi overshadows her so much which sucks bc Bella has actually worked more harder than Gigi in the sense that Gigi rose to fame for being best friends w Kendall, n dating Zayn. Plus bella fits well bc she has such strong characteristics.","VS"
"Sadly we all have to accept the fact that nepotism exists in all industries. Yes, she might have worked very hard but compared to those models w/o background or a multi billionaire dad and famous mother, she did rly little. It is her background that allowed her to walk on the most anticipated runway and appear on billboards wearing high end fashion products. That cannot be denied.","VS"
"Jourdan Dunn didn't walk in 2015 so guess what happened Rihanna was SUPPOSED to be performing but dropped out because Jourdan Dunn wasn't walking because Kendall REPLACED Jourdan even when Kendall didn't go to a casting","VS"
"no, no, no, no! Gigi was, now Bella? Was Kendall, Kylie is now?","VS"
"why cant anyone be happy for her stop being so negative dang","VS"
"i am not happy to see you like this ...","VS"
"I love Bella and I'm so exited to c where her career is headed but
I just find it a bit unfair to be honest how nowadays social media plays such a huge role on the casting of models that's just my opinion tho and don't mean to offend anyone","VS"
"Yeah and next year select Kim kardashian and give her the fantasy bra . For fucks sake take some help from your previous fashion shows and see how the models were back then","VS"
"So happy for Bella ❤️","VS"
"Wtf she is not pretty her and her sister don't fit the mold of a vs model","VS"

"one of the best fantasy bras","VS"
"So what is the purpose of having that bra?","VS"
"I didn't like the tassel but the rest of the bra is beautiful, definitely a step up from last years.","VS"
"The bra is phenomenal 😍😱","VS"
"There are so many people who have worked for the brand way longer than her, who deserve the bra a lot more than Jasmine.","VS"
"Who’s here after the 2017 one?","VS"
"It won't carry my 34DD self","VS"
"i really love the song..it fits perfectly","VS"
"She has such a healthy looking body😍😍","VS"
"This is the first fantasy Bra that is very ugly and simple","VS"
"Can somebody tell me what happen to these fantasy bra after the Victoria fashion show","VS"
"It'a a bra","VS"
"THIS YEAR, 2017, Lais or Elsa should get the fb...so sad Bee will not walk the show again tho. And from all new angels Jo suits me the most tbh. But for the fb, Lais or Elsa, they walked for VS like, since 2010/2011 and they deserve it well😊","VS"
"Romee should have gotten fantasy bra","VS"
"saxy girl dance ban underwear","VS"
"She and candice are my fav angels :)","VS"
"What's the background music called","VS"
"This one is OK I liked last year's better though.","VS"
"She soooooo beautiful xx","VS"
"she's too pretty I just wish the bra wasn't that bland.","VS"
"Jasmine Tookes's just got into VS and she had a chance to wear the fantasy bra while Doutzen had to work so hard for all these years, but still haven't worn it. What happened VS ??","VS"
"I hope sara wear fantasy bra this year!","VS"
"I found out she got the fb in class and i was so happy","VS"

"hate that thing in the middle of the bra. it´s just ugly","VS"
"BTW,  Jasmine and I became best friends when she began wearing the fantasy bra as well as her BFF Jojo Skriver when she became as a full time VS Angel.","VS"
"Who do you think should wear the fantasy bra this year's fashion show?","VS"
"she is so pretty","VS"
"I love Jas and she looks AMAZING but I felt like she wasn't 'right' model to wear it, there are models that have worked for VS longer than her and I felt they kinda deserved to wear the fantasy bra (AKA LAIS but doutzen never even got the chance).","VS"
"In the VS show, they had chains around her body. It made the look prettier... beautiful model","VS"
"Three million dollars for a bra is ridiculous!
Model is a beauty, but no. Plus the shows are weak compared to the earlier shows in the '90's and early 2000's.","VS"
"I saw the picture in class and i was so happy","VS"
"LOOK THIS BODY","VS"
"BEHATI NEXT. I HOPE!!!","VS"
"I have an idea about next years fantasy bra. Next year is going to be 40 years VS. This is really special, so the fantasy bra should be and be worn special. I just thought: even not the most expensive bra, the Royal of Candice, was 10 millions worth. There are actually so many angels, and what would be even more amazing, models like Izabel, Lily Donaldson or Maria Borges, who really did so much for VS, who would deserve to wear the Fantasy Bra. So at the end, there are like 10 angels and models who really would deserve this. So I thought that you could do one segment only composed of Fantasy Bras, each angel or model wearing one worth around 1 million. It would have the same cost as the one of Candice and would be really history making. Dear VS, please think about it.","VS"
"Behati in this year please","VS"
"Wish that Doutzen will wear a fantasy bra..she deserve it....😍","VS"
"when will behati get a chance to wear a fantasy bra","VS"
"omg its so beautiful","VS"
"that FB fits her perfectly...","VS"
"I vote Behati Prinsloo for next year.","VS"
"I'm literally in tears , Jasmine is so beautiful and no matter what anyone says she deserved it , she has one of the best bodies and pure faces and I couldn't picture it on anyone else , it suited her skin tone and everything , so proud and happy ❤❤❤❤","VS"
"Tyra still does it better .","VS"
"Happy for Jasmine but seriously hoped they would give the fb to either Lais / Elsa (since Behati was not present due to pregnancy)","VS"
"One day I am going to be a model for Victoria's Secret 🇨🇷🔝❤that's my dream....","VS"
"After watching this and the fashion show, I learned to love the fantasy bra. Lol at first I thought it looked kind of weird. For some reason it looked like hard candy mints or mentos put together haha but yeah it's a good bra! Not the best but good! Plus I love Jasmine Tookes! Glad she got to wear it this year!","VS"
"She freaking deserves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love jasmine she's one of my favourites","VS"
"it literally reminds me of shark teeth.","VS"
"I find it dangerous when they say ""every girl love diamonds"".
Do we love diamonds or what do they represent socially?","VS"

"Do they get to keep it afterwards? Lol","VS"
"She is the most beautiful Angel","VS"
"Does anyone notice that one part of the bra doesn't fit her boob it looks like it's been pressed in 😂?","VS"
"I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed with fantasy bra this year... it might be worth millions but it sure doesn't look it.  from close up it looks much  better and hopefully on stage with lights it will shine fully :) Adriana & Alessandra and Candice were the best and really looked like million dollar fantasy :)","VS"
"she can piss on my face 😣😍","VS"
"she can piss on my face 😣😍","VS"
"💼💰💳💲💸🐤🐥","VS"
"thats so dope to me that it stays together by a lock","VS"
"I can not describe to u how amazing that looks on her..God I was screaming lol","VS"
"I  like the bra, it looks very Eddie Borgo, and looks different than previous fantasy bras and suits Jasmine really well, she deserves the FB","VS"
"Please give Behati a chance to wear the Fantasy Bra next year, one that suits her fun hippie personality, also Adriana hasn't got a Swarovski outfit yet,","VS"
"fantasy bra looks like a simple bra. and it costs $ 3 million","VS"
"so sad they should use this money to help animals or people","VS"
"pero ese es el que venden, osea ella ya se lo puso, ya lo usò, ya lo sudò, etc. y asi lo venderàn ????  òrale,  me pregunto que haràn con todos esos fantasy bra que no se les venden, los arrumbaràn o que,  tanto trabajo haciendolo y si no se vende por caro ?","VS"
"could anybody kindly give me the script of what she's saying? Some are not clear at all. Thanks","VS"
"some of the models legs are too muscular looking a turn off for me","VS"
"Are you fucking kidding me! Who is she? Alessandra Ambrosio had to wait 12 years to wear the fantasy bra!...Glad I stopped watching after Miranda left.","VS"
"This took blahblahblah hours to make... blah blah blah. HOW MANY FUCKING DAYS ?!!!?","VS"
"The fantasy bras always look worse that the other bras. Such a waste of money, but I guess.","VS"
"What ? Erin, behati, lindsay, doutsen, karlie, they are better for the fantasy bra  so sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😠😠😠👎👎👎👎👎","VS"
"i think this sucks, honestly if you look at the other girl's clothes it looked better on them than it looks on her. She only got a bra with a lock on it and a pair of green underwear lol that sucks. #sucks","VS"
"LAIS pls pls pls","VS"
"Jasmine looks so great with that green fantasy bra. Simple but it suits her. She looks so classy my new fav. But will always be team Candice. 💋","VS"
"Omg I am so happy that Jasmine Tookes got it! She was my favorite last year! And I love the bra it's so much prettier than last year's","VS"
"damn heart eyesss","VS"
"holy smack she is beautiful! definitely the in the top. Her, candace, and adriana are the most gorgeous vs models","VS"
"At first, when I saw the FB in the video. It looks so ugly but when I saw it in details, it looks very beautiful. Proud of Jasmine","VS"
"Beauty","VS"
"this bra looks cheap af, Jasmine deserves more than that. The swarovski bra and panties Josephine Skriver is going to wear is waaay prettier and shiny.","VS"
"Idk why but it makes me feel 10 times better that I get to share my first name with this angel 😍😍😍😘 love ya jas","VS"

"one of the best fantasy bras","VS"
"So what is the purpose of having that bra?","VS"
"I didn't like the tassel but the rest of the bra is beautiful, definitely a step up from last years.","VS"
"The bra is phenomenal 😍😱","VS"
"There are so many people who have worked for the brand way longer than her, who deserve the bra a lot more than Jasmine.","VS"
"Who’s here after the 2017 one?","VS"
"It won't carry my 34DD self","VS"
"i really love the song..it fits perfectly","VS"
"She has such a healthy looking body😍😍","VS"
"This is the first fantasy Bra that is very ugly and simple","VS"
"Can somebody tell me what happen to these fantasy bra after the Victoria fashion show","VS"
"It'a a bra","VS"
"THIS YEAR, 2017, Lais or Elsa should get the fb...so sad Bee will not walk the show again tho. And from all new angels Jo suits me the most tbh. But for the fb, Lais or Elsa, they walked for VS like, since 2010/2011 and they deserve it well😊","VS"
"Romee should have gotten fantasy bra","VS"
"saxy girl dance ban underwear","VS"
"She and candice are my fav angels :)","VS"
"What's the background music called","VS"
"This one is OK I liked last year's better though.","VS"
"She soooooo beautiful xx","VS"
"she's too pretty I just wish the bra wasn't that bland.","VS"
"Jasmine Tookes's just got into VS and she had a chance to wear the fantasy bra while Doutzen had to work so hard for all these years, but still haven't worn it. What happened VS ??","VS"
"I hope sara wear fantasy bra this year!","VS"
"I found out she got the fb in class and i was so happy","VS"
"i just love this girl 😍😍😍","VS"
"hate that thing in the middle of the bra. it´s just ugly","VS"
"BTW,  Jasmine and I became best friends when she began wearing the fantasy bra as well as her BFF Jojo Skriver when she became as a full time VS Angel.","VS"
"Who do you think should wear the fantasy bra this year's fashion show?","VS"
"she is so pretty","VS"
"I love Jas and she looks AMAZING but I felt like she wasn't 'right' model to wear it, there are models that have worked for VS longer than her and I felt they kinda deserved to wear the fantasy bra (AKA LAIS but doutzen never even got the chance).","VS"
"In the VS show, they had chains around her body. It made the look prettier... beautiful model","VS"
"Three million dollars for a bra is ridiculous!
Model is a beauty, but no. Plus the shows are weak compared to the earlier shows in the '90's and early 2000's.","VS"
"I saw the picture in class and i was so happy","VS"
"LOOK THIS BODY","VS"
"BEHATI NEXT. I HOPE!!!","VS"
"I have an idea about next years fantasy bra. Next year is going to be 40 years VS. This is really special, so the fantasy bra should be and be worn special. I just thought: even not the most expensive bra, the Royal of Candice, was 10 millions worth. There are actually so many angels, and what would be even more amazing, models like Izabel, Lily Donaldson or Maria Borges, who really did so much for VS, who would deserve to wear the Fantasy Bra. So at the end, there are like 10 angels and models who really would deserve this. So I thought that you could do one segment only composed of Fantasy Bras, each angel or model wearing one worth around 1 million. It would have the same cost as the one of Candice and would be really history making. Dear VS, please think about it.","VS"
"Behati in this year please","VS"
"Wish that Doutzen will wear a fantasy bra..she deserve it....😍","VS"
"when will behati get a chance to wear a fantasy bra","VS"

"I vote Behati Prinsloo for next year.","VS"
"I'm literally in tears , Jasmine is so beautiful and no matter what anyone says she deserved it , she has one of the best bodies and pure faces and I couldn't picture it on anyone else , it suited her skin tone and everything , so proud and happy ❤❤❤❤","VS"
"Tyra still does it better .","VS"
"Happy for Jasmine but seriously hoped they would give the fb to either Lais / Elsa (since Behati was not present due to pregnancy)","VS"
"One day I am going to be a model for Victoria's Secret 🇨🇷🔝❤that's my dream....","VS"
"After watching this and the fashion show, I learned to love the fantasy bra. Lol at first I thought it looked kind of weird. For some reason it looked like hard candy mints or mentos put together haha but yeah it's a good bra! Not the best but good! Plus I love Jasmine Tookes! Glad she got to wear it this year!","VS"
"She freaking deserves it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love jasmine she's one of my favourites","VS"

"I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed with fantasy bra this year... it might be worth millions but it sure doesn't look it.  from close up it looks much  better and hopefully on stage with lights it will shine fully :) Adriana & Alessandra and Candice were the best and really looked like million dollar fantasy :)","VS"

"fantasy bra looks like a simple bra. and it costs $ 3 million","VS"
"so sad they should use this money to help animals or people","VS"
"pero ese es el que venden, osea ella ya se lo puso, ya lo usò, ya lo sudò, etc. y asi lo venderàn ????  òrale,  me pregunto que haràn con todos esos fantasy bra que no se les venden, los arrumbaràn o que,  tanto trabajo haciendolo y si no se vende por caro ?","VS"
"could anybody kindly give me the script of what she's saying? Some are not clear at all. Thanks","VS"
"some of the models legs are too muscular looking a turn off for me","VS"
"Are you fucking kidding me! Who is she? Alessandra Ambrosio had to wait 12 years to wear the fantasy bra!...Glad I stopped watching after Miranda left.","VS"
"This took blahblahblah hours to make... blah blah blah. HOW MANY FUCKING DAYS ?!!!?","VS"
"The fantasy bras always look worse that the other bras. Such a waste of money, but I guess.","VS"
"What ? Erin, behati, lindsay, doutsen, karlie, they are better for the fantasy bra  so sad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😠😠😠👎👎👎👎👎","VS"
"i think this sucks, honestly if you look at the other girl's clothes it looked better on them than it looks on her. She only got a bra with a lock on it and a pair of green underwear lol that sucks. #sucks","VS"
"LAIS pls pls pls","VS"
"Jasmine looks so great with that green fantasy bra. Simple but it suits her. She looks so classy my new fav. But will always be team Candice. 💋","VS"
"Omg I am so happy that Jasmine Tookes got it! She was my favorite last year! And I love the bra it's so much prettier than last year's","VS"
"damn heart eyesss","VS"

"Well deserved.

"i am so disappointed in this commercial..... they put only one colour angel... what happend to the others??","VS"
"I MISS THE OLD ANGELS!!! ☹️","VS"
"The song sounds like a remixed version to the Lucifer Tv show theme song.","VS"
"Hate to break it to you guys, but this isn't a song. It's a jingle made for the commercial. I wish it was a song too. 😭","VS"
"Hate to be the one to break it to everyone, but those asking if it is a song, it is not. It is only a jingle that was only used for this commercial. Victoria will not be making it a full song any time soon.","VS"

"http://commercial-song.net/2016/10/victorias-secret-beautiful-commercial-song-2016-a-very-private-affair/
This link says the name of the song is ""Slave to Love"" by Bryan Ferry but it is DEFINITELY NOT. I belive the ""You gotta love it"" is just a jingle made for the commercial. I've googled the lyrics, I shazamed the video, and I used Google Music to try and recognize the song but I got nothing :(","VS"
"where Adri, Ales, Lily and Lais? Without them boring to watch","VS"
"what. is. the. song.","VS"
"Candy...Bee..Adri...Ale..Lily..
please please please....
I miss them soooooo much and I'm sooooooooo sad😭😭😭😭","VS"
"What song is this? Who does it? What's the name of it?","VS"
"I know 95% of the comments are asking which song it is, but here goes another one: what's the song?","VS"
"It seems that you have been bought ed, The vsfs is losing all credibility by placing models like Kendall and Gigi to walk on the mark, It seems that the audience of the show this year will be worse than the audience of the show last year.
Nobody wants to see Kendall Jenner walking to the VSFS2016, Gigi and Kendall don't deserve to be in the VSFS. Unlike Kendall and Gigi Hundreds of models work hard all year to get a spot in the VSFS. Kendall and Gigi are where they are because they were already rich and famous this is called nepotism, I'm tired to see everyone paying attention to Kendall and Gigi just because they are beautiful and famous, they have no talent several other models that work hard (for example Jourdan Dunn, Nadine Leopold, Lauren de Graaf, Shanina Shaik) do not receive the recognition they deserve. The only thing that Kendall, Gigi have contributed to fashion is elitism and nepotism.","VS"
"where is sara?","VS"
"you have to use lais Ribeiro she's amazing","VS"

"Why can't all women look like this","VS"

"The thing I liked about VS was that a few (not many, but in the fashion industry that's a lot) of the girls were always a bit curvier, still completely unrealistically fit and toned, but healthy looking. There is nothing wrong with being naturally skinny, I myself am quite below average, but when promoting a label that is meant to be worn by ""real people"" and not just the top people in the industry, a label that is looked at (because of their PINK collection) by young girls who will set these girl's natural bodies as an ideal that they should work towards, I don't think that it's right to only showcase one body type.
If you are someone who is working out in an attempt to achieve this body just know:
1) These girls make a living on looking like this, they get paid to try and have a team of people making sure they keep their regime going
2) They were all born this way, this isn't something that can be healthily achieved if your body isn't built like this, they work out and don't eat to maintain these bodies.

"The thing I liked about VS was that a few (not many, but in the fashion industry that's a lot) of the girls were always a bit curvier, still completely unrealistically fit and toned, but healthy looking. There is nothing wrong with being naturally skinny, I myself am quite below average, but when promoting a label that is meant to be worn by ""real people"" and not just the top people in the industry, a label that is looked at (because of their PINK collection) by young girls who will set these girl's natural bodies as an ideal that they should work towards, I don't think that it's right to only showcase one body type.
If you are someone who is working out in an attempt to achieve this body just know:
1) These girls make a living on looking like this, they get paid to try and have a team of people making sure they keep their regime going
2) They were all born this way, this isn't something that can be healthily achieved if your body isn't built like this, they work out and don't eat to maintain these bodies.

I hope to see more girls of different shapes and sizes on runways, at least for highstreet brands like this, high fashion will hopefully follow.","VS"

"The brand is over. Skinny as hell girls. Even they asked them to lose more weight.

"Why are so many people rude in the comments? Why do some of you people act like you know other people in the comments? Like you would know if I'm healthy or not! Don't tell me I'm unhealthy or not as healthy as you when you don't even know for sure! Emily Duva, I wasn't saying I'm healthier than you. I repeated what you said as sarcasm. To get you going.I'm probably just as healthy as you. You don't know for sure that you're healthier than me. So stop stating it like it's a fact. Lots of people in public call me thin and skinny. I'm not ugly either. I'm just as pretty as Ariana Grande.","VS"

"These models are so fit and healthy, even when they're really skinny! I have only seen one picture of Candice where she looked really skinny,but not like a bunch of bones sticking out. She looked awesome.     
I originally said something different, but I changed my mind. None of them are too skinny. However, someone said that all of these models are definitely healthier than me. Someone liked the comment too. Actually , I would say that I'm probably just as healthy as them.  I make green smoothies, Vitamin C super smoothie bowls and I'm starting to drink more water and the other day I danced to 19 music videos. I didn't stop and I was even singing at the same time. Even if my body doesn't look the same as any of them, that doesn't automatically mean I'm not as healthy as them. Plus, I noticed I already lost some weight. I know I'm healthy.","VS"

I know I'm some minor, and maybe unimportant, person but I think that's how everyone is at first. Until they get scouted, noticed, or work hard enough to make a name for themselves. I hope that can be me soon enough. Much love for all of the directors, producers, angels, models, ect. working on the show this year. xoxo. ❤️❤️","VS"

"I think it would be really cool if victoria secret made a segment with sketches sent by fans. There is a lot of talent out there! And they should give a price to the best outfit. I would die of happiness if I see an angel wearing something I designed.","VS"
"Why there are so many great pieces that dont make it to the show?","VS"
"Oh my preparation is no joke wow","VS"
"Why are the themes so similar to the ones you already had? You could use a theme where each model presents something about her country via her outfit or Disney princesses and each of the Angels can be one princess. I personally think the Disney one would be awesome. PINK section looks great though. Also, some of the regular models who deserve to be an Angel are not one. There's too many Angels and it isn't special anymore. I enjoy watching the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, just like every teenage girl does, but the way it's going, I don't think I'll watch it anymore. Too many Angels, the artists get more attention than the models, the outfits are too similar, the models are mostly white(I am white and to me it looks so bland and boring, even the best outfits look 10 times worse because it looks like it's the same person wearing them). I get that you're trying to sell the fantasy of the perfect girls, but it just looks awful to me. You could add more Asian and black models, redheads, Indians and Native Americans. Make only the senior models Angels and don't make models like Iza go to castings. She's earned to walk the show without it. Get more creative with themes and make the show more about the models, like having only one artist play each year. And could you give the next Fantasy Bra to Behati? She's truly wonderful and I think it's her time to shine. The models are great and they deserve to walk the show, but only the best of the best deserve an Angel spot. Still love the brand and the models, but some things should change. Oh, and the wings are always fantastic.","VS"
"the lady looks like adult Lorde","VS"

"Hey Victoria Secret! How about creating a design competition where designers from all over the world can create and submit their designs for a particular theme in the next show!","VS"
"Am I the only one that thinks Monica and Sophia are really pretty?","VS"
"it's amazing how they really make the sketches come to life","VS"
"I love the idea of the models with the PINK dogs, but I think it would be amazing for one or two of the girls to walk real dogs (like tiny Yorkies or pomeranians) down the runway! The dogs could have little outfits or sequined collars and stuff!","VS"
"Where do all the outfits from the last years go? There are so many nice things. So many nice jackets and details that I have never seen anywhere else. By the way the pink outfits will be huge! Can't wait to see the final results ♥","VS"

"She is the only angel who looks way more beautiful with minimalist makeup..Her skin is the best among all others.","VS"
"Lily is so classically beautiful, looks so good in print and commercial, one of the most eloquent speakers amongst the women, but Lord her walk is weird...just a lil bit off.","VS"
"Ballett is not so good for you","VS"
"If only you could walk that runway, darling","VS"
"Damn these models that have kids snap back quicker than a rubber band.","VS"
"My favourite","VS"
"She was a weird choice for an angel","VS"
"Nice info you sound like a cool person","VS"
"Sylla is a fag","VS"
"i actually had no idea she had a kid :O","VS"
"She is so modest I love her xx","VS"
"Tbh, the only problem with Lily is her walk but overall, she is actually a great angel. She's a great spokesperson for the brand and she may not have that full bombshell look like Candice or Adriana but damn sure she is fit and healthy and obviously, sexy as well","VS"
"she is sp beautiful 😱😍","VS"
"she's nice, but her walk is horrible","VS"
"I love Lilly so much, I find it unfair they gave her a horrid fb :((((","VS"
"Lilyyyyy😍😍","VS"
"Do u think I can grow more at 16 if I'm 5'4 and my mom is 5'3 and my dad is 5'9 ?","VS"

"I feel like these castings went downhill none of these girls were very bombshell and the fact that izabel goulart and lily Donaldson had to go to castings but Kendall and Gigi didn't is so stupid!!!!!! I luv you vs but get it together this year!","VS"
"I feel fat","VS"
"The girls who've walked many times before shouldn't have to go to casting again! I don't get it. They're much better than the new girls. The new castings are just not up to par with the old VS models at all. And I don't think it's fair to have new girls become Angels when some models have put in so much time for VS. Gone are the days where hard work and time gets you to the top. Now you just have to be popular. ","VS"
"Who is the girl at the minute 2:55?","VS"
"Everytime Bridget Malcolm speaks, it's like also hearing Margot Robbie talk.","VS"
"who is the blonde one at 0.27?","VS"
"👎Kendall","VS"
"am I the only one who's looking at their shoes?","VS"
"magda was there and she wasn't casted.whyyy!!! vs whyyy. There are hard working models and veterans who has to go to castings daily yet you put Models who casted for only once and they already feel as if they're getting the show the next year without having to go to castings.

"Did anyone else see Karlie's name on the board? I would have loved to see her again, but she is crazy busy.","VS"
"Can we have an Asian angel in 2017??? U know it's kinda abt time to have an Asian angel, it's 2017 where diversity is the In trend.","VS"
"Actually, VS is smart to bring in irina shayk though she's a bit out of shape since she's allegedly pregnant, coz VS needs real bombshell in order to maintain some sort of their integrity as the VS brand.  Plenty of girls on VS now aren't stereotypically bombshells though they are really pretty.","VS"
"I accept that unfairness and nepotism  exists in this world in all fields, but, kindly make Bella go through casting again next year!!!! She sucks in 2016 VS and it's only fair to make her go to casting again in 2017.  Kendall has never done a casting for VS and Gigi didn't come for casting in 2016 (which I presume it's caused she was INVITED by VS to automatically be part of the show), these 2 girls r not spectacular and in fact I believe plenty of other girls r better than them, BUT AT LEAST THEY DONT SUCK THAT BADLY AS BELLA ON VS..... Bella is the worst model VS has ever had on their show.... she may be ok in other high fashion runway shows, but she REALLY SUCKS ON VS!!!","VS"
"Actually, I think I know why Kendall was never in any VS casting.  She was personally INVITED by VS to be one of their models without the need to go through ang casting, just like Cara who was invited by one of the casting directors to be on VS show without the need to go through casting.  Unfair to other models? Yes.  But the reality is Kendall has s huge following, her involvement in the show brings huge publicity, and publicity translates to sales.","VS"
"So many comments abt Iza and stuffs saying that VS is treating her like shit.  But actually VS is the one doing the charity coz Iza's the one who bowed out early in her VS Angel's contract like back in those days when she was actually a VS Angels, just so she could do other jobs.  Afterwards she realized VS provides the best exposure as it's the most watched fashion show on the planet, she comes crawling back to VS every year just to be one of their regular models.  So yeah. Wat happened to her is her own fault.  Her own arrogance and Stupidity back in those days costed her the VS Angels contract that she used to have.","VS"
"Bella Hadid *walks in*
everyone: *wow* you look amazing your body is great
Me: yeah and your sister Gigi also looked great and the Kardashian's tall girl Kendall she didn't even had to cast cause *reasons* b*tch don't make me come there myself and freaking slap you","VS"
"why is there a few African-American girls","VS"
"Can someone tell me where is Jac? Why isn't she an angel anymore?","VS"
"Its so funny and cringy to see how hard some of these girls try to be nice, funny and bubbly just to get in the show like just be yourself its really disturbing","VS"
"When I'm older I want to be a VS Model so bad. I've wanted this since I was in 5th grade, seeing how happy those girls are on stage, and how hard they've worked. I just don't know where to sign up for casting if anyone can help me please.","VS"
"I love how encouraging they are! Saying how well they're doing and how nice they look","VS"
"Why is joans, iza, bruna and lily d. there?","VS"
"I wanna see Kiko Mizohara on the VS runway","VS"
"Magdelena Frackowiak was at castings, but didn't make the show:(. Unfortunate that she was probably replaced by an instagram model aka Bella, Gigi, or Kendall.","VS"
"Bottom line, now-a-days, if you have the ""right"" last name, such as Hadid or Jenner, you have far greater of a chance of making it and you have to work far less. I have so much more respect for the other girls who made it all on their own.","VS"
"i'm 12 and I already dream to be a victoria secret model but is just a dream :/","VS"
"who's that at 0:42?","VS"
"that girl in the beginning shot laughing with the great curly hair is so amazingly beautiful to me.. like damn......lovely","VS"
"Just a thought, maybe for one show VS should not do the castings, and have new models (up to 10) every year, and just send invitation like what they did to Cara to the major today vs models like Karlie, Isabeli, Magdalena, Sigrid, Lily D, Izabel, Toni, Constance, Sui, Liu, Ming, Jacquelyn, Shanina, Joan, Cindy, Devon, just to name a few. Don't think the same way about Jourdan tho, lol. 
That would be BIG 👏🏻✨
After all these years, they have had a large number of VS-worthy models, right? 

Btw Doutzen can still walk on the show, right?","VS"
"Hey VS, how about Ashley Graham? I mean, she has worked alongside Aldridge right?","VS"
"Why they all are so skinny? They can't be normal? Have some meat in your body, eat some food is illegal? Overweight people is disgusting?","VS"
"Who was the blonde were they said  ""this year theres on image that we chose""","VS"
"Bridget is very gorgeous!","VS"
"I vote Naomi and Gisele to come back","VS"
"Bella Nadia is gorgeous but she didn't deserve this,there were girls who really should have got in,no hate❤️💖","VS"
"Im sorry i love bella but some other girls bodies were more fit and amazing like they were ooing aahing but some girls i saw before her were soo fit yes her body is gorgeous shit i would love it but because of her name they put her on a pedestal. All these women are gorgeous and TALL !","VS"
"Shame on you VS. Izabel shouldn't attend castings, she has been walking VS shows before Kendall Jenner was even a teenager.","VS"
"I wish Blanca Padilla would walk again. :/","VS"
"Kendal is there just because shes famous! Not talent","VS"
"Imo only the official angels should not need to attend castings. Gigi and Kendall should be made to attend even if they are a sure thing. If they cannot make time in their schedule to show up to a casting for one of the biggest fashion shows, they aren't worth it, no matter how famous they are.","VS"
"When you're 5'9, wanna be a model, but can't because you hate working out and like Kelly's cheese-fries to good.","VS"
"I hope Janine tugunon will be one of the Victoria's secret angels and walk on the VS fashion show next year. 🙏🙌","VS"
"Luma Grothe is Angel material <3","VS"
"omg  nice , fun yes ;;ahsudhasudhfsudh","VS"

"40 girls, bro I've only got a one bedroom condo..??","VS"
"Keke you can come home to me at the end of the day feed the puppy and be a happy girl 🌝","VS"
"Chick thinks she's on 8 mile bout to bust a rap huh 😊","VS"
"That blonde Aussie though 👌","VS"
"i kinda understand gigi but bella and Kendall? they're so plan and there's nothing special in their appearance or personalities. it's a popularity contest","VS"
"her: ""it is so much work to get in the show, you cant just wake up and walk in the casting....""
me: kendall jenner did

i mean she was not even in the casting tape","VS"
"So many people whining about the fact that Kendall, GiGi & Bella were cast while others were not. These young women have a HUGE following and it's only smart for them to be there as they attract attention and viewers for the show BUT they are also stunning and completely deserving. Bella walked into that room and they oooohed and ahhhhed because I mean...look at her! You don't get to looking like that without some fraction of hard work and commitment. No one but the people who know them personally have a clue about how hard they've worked and I'm sure each of them have had there fair share of knock downs and rejections from designers. 
I'm happy for these beautiful women and I know I'm going to enjoy the show!!! ❤️","VS"
"Yes Victoria Secret are not looking for a pretty face, instead they are looking for who has the most instagram followers!! K,G hint hint","VS"
"I dream of the day that VS puts women of ALL body shapes into this show. This show is what is so wrong about society today. Impressionable young girls watch this on TV and think their bodies should look this thin and practically emaciated. Don't get me wrong, these models are absolutely beautiful. But this show glamorizes extremely thin perfect bodies in lingerie as if this is the only body type that should feel pretty. I understand this is how the modeling industry always has been but VS should take a step forward and include more than one body shape. I've struggled with an eating disorder so as much as I know I should not watch this show every year, I always do and I always hate myself for long afterwards as I sink back into my disordered eating patterns. Just makes me sad.","VS"
"They should give the non-""major"" girls a chance I feel like they make it political. Geez, be original...","VS"
"Honestly watching this makes me so motivated and inspired because this is genuinely where I want to be in life","VS"
"Soo Sasha Luss is not walking???? WHAT A SHAME. Nepotism is the thing that rules nowadays with VS, how sad.","VS"
"wen Bella came out I was lik ""awww bella"" ♡","VS"
"Sucks to see that Joan and Izabel still have to do casting meanwhile Kendall just gets invited","VS"
"too many new faces","VS"
"VSFS wont be complete if theres no Lily Donaldson is the show. She walked on VSFS a lot of times and shes worthy to be an angel even before","VS"
"who cares lima the best she out shines all of them ! no one comes close to her so gorgeous ! unbelievable fierce she the hottest ! I only watch if she there ! Candice is hot to .","VS"
"including this year, Iza have walked the show 12 times. it's crazy that she still has to go to casting. with her killer body, incredible walk, and amazing personality like seriously?","VS"
"I hope behati comes back","VS"
"who is this girl? 0:25","VS"
"i would be great at this job","VS"
"Who's that at 0:41?","VS"
"If you are born in rich family &  have a lot of followers, you can skip all the casting process, don't you=_=?
So unfair for those top models who have been modeling for a long time.","VS"
"Why Izabel goulart had to do the casting and gigi hadid ( who has a terrible catwalk ) hadn't to do?","VS"
"The made that Izabel make a casting?? After all these years?? . Sorry my english is bad...","VS"
"You guys are a little harsh to Izabel. she still cast until now? that was disrespectful tho","VS"
"Joan Smalls, Lily Donaldson <3 And finally Irina Shayk !! how many years we have been waiting for !! She should already be an angel, but she only held the casting. Bella Hadid - it's sad. She not looks amazing. Casting Victoria’s Secret is always fun","VS"
"2:06 Izabel Goulart ❤️❤️❤️","VS"
"why does the real supermodels like Joan  and iza need to go to casting","VS"
"What annoys me is how they work so hard... Kendall.. Gigi...now Bella? Did they work hard or is it because of who they are? Hmmmmmmmm","VS"

"Taylor is gorgeous can't wait for the show.","VS"
"Izabel is always the best! She rocks! I'm so sad that she just got one outfit😭","VS"
"Why is Kendall coming Back when she barely made any lasting impression last year!!!??","VS"
"guys whats not to understand? they're obviously gonna cast the instagram famous models who have millions of followers...someone like bella hadid doesnt even have to try tbh","VS"
"Janine Tugonon 😔😔😢😢","VS"
"Iza should be a shoo-in by now! vs, are you not reading what your audience wants?","VS"

"No entiendo!
¿Por qué Lily Donalson hace casting nuevamente , si ella desde el 2011 que desfila en el Victoria's Secret FS?","VS"
"N E X T PART PLEASE","VS"
"LUMAAAAAAA!!!!!!","VS"
"i will never understand why izabel goulart who is a former angel and has walked the show 11 consecutive times  (since 2005) would go thru castings alongside rookie models trying out for the first time, same with lily donaldson who has walked the show 6 consecutive times (since 2010) i bet kendall jenner did even go to castings since they have never showed her..... shame on you ed razek, monica mitro and the rest of the vs producers","VS"
"all hot :D","VS"

She sucks in 2016 VS and it's only fair to make her go to casting again in 2017.  Kendall has never done a casting for VS and Gigi didn't come for casting in 2016 (which I presume it's caused she was INVITED by VS to automatically be part of the show), these 2 girls r not spectacular and in fact I believe plenty of other girls r better than them, BUT AT LEAST THEY DONT SUCK THAT BADLY AS BELLA ON VS..... Bella is the worst model VS has ever had on their show.... she may be ok in other high fashion runway shows, but she REALLY SUCKS ON VS!!!","VS"
"Actually, I think I know why Kendall was never in any VS casting.  She was personally INVITED by VS to be one of their models without the need to go through ang casting, just like Cara who was invited by one of the casting directors to be on VS show without the need to go through casting.  Unfair to other models? Yes.  But the reality is Kendall has s huge following, her involvement in the show brings huge publicity, and publicity translates to sales.","VS"
"So many comments abt Iza and stuffs saying that VS is treating her like shit.  But actually VS is the one doing the charity coz Iza's the one who bowed out early in her VS Angel's contract like back in those days when she was actually a VS Angels, just so she could do other jobs.  Afterwards she realized VS provides the best exposure as it's the most watched fashion show on the planet, she comes crawling back to VS every year just to be one of their regular models.  So yeah. Wat happened to her is her own fault.  Her own arrogance and Stupidity back in those days costed her the VS Angels contract that she used to have.","VS"
"Bella Hadid *walks in*
everyone: *wow* you look amazing your body is great
Me: yeah and your sister Gigi also looked great and the Kardashian's tall girl Kendall she didn't even had to cast cause *reasons* b*tch don't make me come there myself and freaking slap you","VS"
"why is there a few African-American girls","VS"
"Can someone tell me where is Jac? Why isn't she an angel anymore?","VS"
"Its so funny and cringy to see how hard some of these girls try to be nice, funny and bubbly just to get in the show like just be yourself its really disturbing","VS"
"When I'm older I want to be a VS Model so bad. I've wanted this since I was in 5th grade, seeing how happy those girls are on stage, and how hard they've worked. I just don't know where to sign up for casting if anyone can help me please.","VS"
"I love how encouraging they are! Saying how well they're doing and how nice they look","VS"
"Why is joans, iza, bruna and lily d. there?","VS"
"I wanna see Kiko Mizohara on the VS runway","VS"
"Magdelena Frackowiak was at castings, but didn't make the show:(. Unfortunate that she was probably replaced by an instagram model aka Bella, Gigi, or Kendall.","VS"
"Bottom line, now-a-days, if you have the ""right"" last name, such as Hadid or Jenner, you have far greater of a chance of making it and you have to work far less. I have so much more respect for the other girls who made it all on their own.","VS"
"i'm 12 and I already dream to be a victoria secret model but is just a dream :/","VS"
"who's that at 0:42?","VS"
"that girl in the beginning shot laughing with the great curly hair is so amazingly beautiful to me.. like damn......lovely","VS"
"Just a thought, maybe for one show VS should not do the castings, and have new models (up to 10) every year, and just send invitation like what they did to Cara to the major today vs models like Karlie, Isabeli, Magdalena, Sigrid, Lily D, Izabel, Toni, Constance, Sui, Liu, Ming, Jacquelyn, Shanina, Joan, Cindy, Devon, just to name a few. Don't think the same way about Jourdan tho, lol. 
That would be BIG 👏🏻✨
After all these years, they have had a large number of VS-worthy models, right? 

Btw Doutzen can still walk on the show, right?","VS"
"Hey VS, how about Ashley Graham? I mean, she has worked alongside Aldridge right?","VS"
"Why they all are so skinny? They can't be normal? Have some meat in your body, eat some food is illegal? Overweight people is disgusting?","VS"
"Who was the blonde were they said  ""this year theres on image that we chose""","VS"
"Bridget is very gorgeous!","VS"
"I vote Naomi and Gisele to come back","VS"
"Bella Nadia is gorgeous but she didn't deserve this,there were girls who really should have got in,no hate❤️💖","VS"
"Im sorry i love bella but some other girls bodies were more fit and amazing like they were ooing aahing but some girls i saw before her were soo fit yes her body is gorgeous shit i would love it but because of her name they put her on a pedestal. All these women are gorgeous and TALL !","VS"
"Shame on you VS. Izabel shouldn't attend castings, she has been walking VS shows before Kendall Jenner was even a teenager.","VS"
"I wish Blanca Padilla would walk again. :/","VS"
"Kendal is there just because shes famous! Not talent","VS"
"Imo only the official angels should not need to attend castings. Gigi and Kendall should be made to attend even if they are a sure thing. If they cannot make time in their schedule to show up to a casting for one of the biggest fashion shows, they aren't worth it, no matter how famous they are.","VS"
"When you're 5'9, wanna be a model, but can't because you hate working out and like Kelly's cheese-fries to good.","VS"
"I hope Janine tugunon will be one of the Victoria's secret angels and walk on the VS fashion show next year. 🙏🙌","VS"

"That blonde Aussie though 👌","VS"
"i kinda understand gigi but bella and Kendall? they're so plan and there's nothing special in their appearance or personalities. it's a popularity contest","VS"
"her: ""it is so much work to get in the show, you cant just wake up and walk in the casting....""
me: kendall jenner did

i mean she was not even in the casting tape","VS"
"So many people whining about the fact that Kendall, GiGi & Bella were cast while others were not. These young women have a HUGE following and it's only smart for them to be there as they attract attention and viewers for the show BUT they are also stunning and completely deserving. Bella walked into that room and they oooohed and ahhhhed because I mean...look at her! You don't get to looking like that without some fraction of hard work and commitment. No one but the people who know them personally have a clue about how hard they've worked and I'm sure each of them have had there fair share of knock downs and rejections from designers. 
I'm happy for these beautiful women and I know I'm going to enjoy the show!!! ❤️","VS"
"Yes Victoria Secret are not looking for a pretty face, instead they are looking for who has the most instagram followers!! K,G hint hint","VS"
"I dream of the day that VS puts women of ALL body shapes into this show. This show is what is so wrong about society today. Impressionable young girls watch this on TV and think their bodies should look this thin and practically emaciated. Don't get me wrong, these models are absolutely beautiful. But this show glamorizes extremely thin perfect bodies in lingerie as if this is the only body type that should feel pretty. I understand this is how the modeling industry always has been but VS should take a step forward and include more than one body shape. I've struggled with an eating disorder so as much as I know I should not watch this show every year, I always do and I always hate myself for long afterwards as I sink back into my disordered eating patterns. Just makes me sad.","VS"
"They should give the non-""major"" girls a chance I feel like they make it political. Geez, be original...","VS"
"Honestly watching this makes me so motivated and inspired because this is genuinely where I want to be in life","VS"
"Soo Sasha Luss is not walking???? WHAT A SHAME. Nepotism is the thing that rules nowadays with VS, how sad.","VS"
"wen Bella came out I was lik ""awww bella"" ♡","VS"
"Sucks to see that Joan and Izabel still have to do casting meanwhile Kendall just gets invited","VS"
"too many new faces","VS"
"VSFS wont be complete if theres no Lily Donaldson is the show. She walked on VSFS a lot of times and shes worthy to be an angel even before","VS"
"who cares lima the best she out shines all of them ! no one comes close to her so gorgeous ! unbelievable fierce she the hottest ! I only watch if she there ! Candice is hot to .","VS"
"including this year, Iza have walked the show 12 times. it's crazy that she still has to go to casting. with her killer body, incredible walk, and amazing personality like seriously?","VS"
"I hope behati comes back","VS"
"who is this girl? 0:25","VS"
"i would be great at this job","VS"
"Who's that at 0:41?","VS"
"If you are born in rich family &  have a lot of followers, you can skip all the casting process, don't you=_=?
So unfair for those top models who have been modeling for a long time.","VS"
"Why Izabel goulart had to do the casting and gigi hadid ( who has a terrible catwalk ) hadn't to do?","VS"
"The made that Izabel make a casting?? After all these years?? . Sorry my english is bad...","VS"
"You guys are a little harsh to Izabel. she still cast until now? that was disrespectful tho","VS"
"Joan Smalls, Lily Donaldson <3 And finally Irina Shayk !! how many years we have been waiting for !! She should already be an angel, but she only held the casting. Bella Hadid - it's sad. She not looks amazing. Casting Victoria’s Secret is always fun","VS"
"2:06 Izabel Goulart ❤️❤️❤️","VS"
"why does the real supermodels like Joan  and iza need to go to casting","VS"
"What annoys me is how they work so hard... Kendall.. Gigi...now Bella? Did they work hard or is it because of who they are? Hmmmmmmmm","VS"
"wheres janine tugonon?","VS"

"Taylor is gorgeous can't wait for the show.","VS"
"Izabel is always the best! She rocks! I'm so sad that she just got one outfit😭","VS"
"Why is Kendall coming Back when she barely made any lasting impression last year!!!??","VS"
"guys whats not to understand? they're obviously gonna cast the instagram famous models who have millions of followers...someone like bella hadid doesnt even have to try tbh","VS"
"Janine Tugonon 😔😔😢😢","VS"
"Iza should be a shoo-in by now! vs, are you not reading what your audience wants?","VS"

"No entiendo!
¿Por qué Lily Donalson hace casting nuevamente , si ella desde el 2011 que desfila en el Victoria's Secret FS?","VS"
"N E X T PART PLEASE","VS"
"LUMAAAAAAA!!!!!!","VS"
"i will never understand why izabel goulart who is a former angel and has walked the show 11 consecutive times  (since 2005) would go thru castings alongside rookie models trying out for the first time, same with lily donaldson who has walked the show 6 consecutive times (since 2010) i bet kendall jenner did even go to castings since they have never showed her..... shame on you ed razek, monica mitro and the rest of the vs producers","VS"
"all hot :D","VS"
"bring back Isabeli Fontana e Caroline trentine","VS"
"Why they never put Emily Didonato on the show?? Its so crazy to not see her on the vsfs","VS"

"Who's the girl at 0:41?","VS"
"This is my dream and I'm only 15 years old and cca 177 cm","VS"
"I feel like these castings went downhill none of these girls were very bombshell and the fact that izabel goulart and lily Donaldson had to go to castings but Kendall and Gigi didn't is so stupid!!!!!! I luv you vs but get it together this year!","VS"
"I feel fat","VS"
"The girls who've walked many times before shouldn't have to go to casting again! I don't get it. They're much better than the new girls. The new castings are just not up to par with the old VS models at all. And I don't think it's fair to have new girls become Angels when some models have put in so much time for VS. Gone are the days where hard work and time gets you to the top. Now you just have to be popular. ","VS"
"Who is the girl at the minute 2:55?","VS"
"Everytime Bridget Malcolm speaks, it's like also hearing Margot Robbie talk.","VS"

"👎Kendall","VS"
"am I the only one who's looking at their shoes?","VS"
"magda was there and she wasn't casted.whyyy!!! vs whyyy. There are hard working models and veterans who has to go to castings daily yet you put Models who casted for only once and they already feel as if they're getting the show the next year without having to go to castings.

"Can we have an Asian angel in 2017??? U know it's kinda abt time to have an Asian angel, it's 2017 where diversity is the In trend.","VS"
"Actually, VS is smart to bring in irina shayk though she's a bit out of shape since she's allegedly pregnant, coz VS needs real bombshell in order to maintain some sort of their integrity as the VS brand.  Plenty of girls on VS now aren't stereotypically bombshells though they are really pretty.","VS"

"She's so inspirational! I love Adriana Lima!","VS"
"NOBODY can inspire me better than this woman in terms of lifestyle. I've seen Gisele, mesmerized by Naomi's walk, got enchanted by Karolina's sexiness, but ONLY Adriana made me ACTUALLY move and work out and be the best better of myself. For me that's the essence of Victoria's secret. Inspiring someone to be their best self. ❤️","VS"

"Br","VS"
"at 0:12 she looks like a 20 something year old. 😮😮😮😮 she is stunning.","VS"
"Adriana worked so fucking hard to get where she is today. Kendall on the other hand, have not worked hard, she got to model for big designers like Karl Lagerfeld just beacause she is sister to the kardashians.. it sickening. Adriana work soooo hard while Kendall get everything served on a silver plate. Smh, there are sooo many amazing models out there who work their asses off to get to be well known. But they never get noticed or get anywhere. While Kendall, who look like any other average teenager, get so many fucking amazing modeling gigs. She wouldnt even be walking on the vs show if it wasn't for her family. That's for sure.","VS"
"she just breath taking and sweet ! that's why she on top !","VS"

"Legend.","VS"
"Real angel ❤","VS"
"My Queen","VS"
"Unlike those shitty Instagram models (kendall, Gigi bella whatever) that had everything given to them, Adriana earned. And that's the difference. Forget about the likes. She is the heart and soul of VS, and it's funny how VS wants to have new faces and fresh Instagram models, they are NOTHING compared to Adriana's beauty and personally.","VS"
"the best","VS"
"Adriana is sexiest 🍒model in VS, in my opinion. She's a really ANGEL. I'm waiting HER on vsfs.","VS"

"Adriana deserves a super video, beyond 50 seconds.
Building a 20-year career as a model and ever increasing is not anyone who can.
Adriana is a very dedicated model giving herself completely to all her work.
Adriana is an explosive bomb! Adri ♥","VS"

"The african in this show looks like black shit  and makes the show ugly","VS"
"Josephine looked sooo beautiful in her outfit, 2016 swarovski outfit was better than 2017 one","VS"
"Adriana tá tão acostumada","VS"
"It’s 2017 and I still wonder why they let Stella open bright night segment
Jas was wearing the FB not her and besides her walk was hideous, totally botched the turn","VS"
"OMG, La reacción de Stella me encantó 😍😂","VS"
"5his fitting and outfits were better than this year","VS"
"Adriana's reaction is really funny. I mean she opened so many segments and shows that when she hears she will open the segment, she doesn't have any exciting or joyful reaction.. but she realizes that this video will actually be posted in Youtube or whatever her mouth is open with full of surprise... :)","VS"
"Adriana should have gotten Josephine’s outfit that year. Smh. I still feel so bad looking at her outfit except she was the most captivating onstage so...she is absolutely gorgeous. Lais is too, god. And Jasmine tbh. I think in this video, these 3 are the prettiest, but Josephine’s outfit oh my god...also the Fantasy Bra of course.","VS"
"Josephines outfit should have been given to adriana","VS"
"I wanna see Adriana Lima opening the next show!! She slays!!!!","VS"
"My dream","VS"
"that fantasy bra sucks","VS"
"Adriana is not shocked after they told her that she will open a section. I mean, she had opened shows, wore fantasy bras. Its like a no big of a deal to her.","VS"
"nobody gives a fuck about vs .. anymore","VS"
"In the min. 2:36 stella looks like abbey lee kershaw, sara in the neon demond","VS"
"0:50 Who's that ??? And that costume 😍😍","VS"
"Can somebody honestly tell me why Kendall gets picked? She had zero attitude, just a skinny body and not an angel face. Give me candice, Adriana, Rosie, those women have personalities and ethereal beauty. And aren't cunty 😂","VS"
"I wish they would've added the wings to Martha's outfit that were on the sketch for it.","VS"
"taylor is TOO overrated","VS"
"i have the same bodies as them, and this makes me so confident","VS"
"When they told Adriana she was opening the section she was like: Been there done that...","VS"
"Lais Ribeiro is Beautiful","VS"
"where's Candice? :o","VS"
"What's the name of the blonde who kind of resembles Candice? Sorry, I don't know her name. The model at 2:15?","VS"
"OMG Jasmine Tookes, she is so stunning.","VS"
"i wish jordan wouldve opened the show or closed it with the fantasy bra","VS"
"2:05 when Stella found out that she would be opening a section. Her reaction is the most personality I've ever seen from her! 🙄","VS"
"Do you think I should wear your outfit maybe call in sick or something? 🌝","VS"
"You better be here in a couple of days or you won't be getting any sprinkles on your ice cream","VS"
"I love high maintenance women they are my favourite especially the hot ones who feel entitled 😉","VS"
"jasmine looks beyond beyond amazing","VS"
"Sara is so beautiful","VS"
"Lais is a god","VS"
"sometimes a good combination small elements is strong enough to overshadow the rest. Adriana latex peplum waist piece killed all those 1000s Swarovski crystals and wings for good","VS"
"Would someone please tell me the name of the song that playing in the background?","VS"
"I'm so shocked they gave Kendall wings...like, I get that they want her there for press, but her walk last year was so awkward and lack-luster. . She needs to earn her wings just like everyone else.","VS"
"Saw some photos and a video snippet from the fashion show.

1. While a lot are a rehash from previous shows, some of the outfits look good, especially that dragon wrapped around Elsa. Although I hope the outfits view well on the runway. Shame if it will be edited badly post production.
2. I couldn't care less who opens the show, but I would be really happy if it's Adriana, Elsa, or Lais.
2. Too much attention on Bella Hadid and The Weeknd. Couldn't care less if they are still dating or already broken up, but that had some touches of Anne V/Adam and Behati/Adam there.  In the after party, too much attention on the Hadid family as well. Ugh. Have to admit the silver train with sleeves on Bella is really, really nice (I love fabric trains and off shoulder sleeves!)
3. Doutzen Kroes and her husband Sunnery James went to see the show. Doutzen deserves to be on that runway but anyway, that ship sailed a long time ago.
4. I really,really miss Behati.
5. I have the same red bra that Kendall wore. Lais rocked that bra on the online store photos. On Kendall... meh
6. Maria Borges should be an Angel this 2017!
7. I couldn't care less about Jasmine and this year's Fantasy Bra. I don't like Jasmine's body, walk and poses either. Her runway turn is blah as well... BUT, she wore it better than Lily last year. Would have been really nicer if she posed a bit longer in the runway with Bruno Mars crooning 24K Magic in background.","VS"
"klossy is in the show this year isn't she???","VS"
"2:08 refrigerator","VS"
"gays do u know links where i can watch full show?","VS"
"💜💛💚💙","VS"
"the music of video is so amazing can i get it ?","VS"
"Adriana is THE best","VS"
"I'm hoping Behati gets the fantasy bra next year. And Lais the year afterwards","VS"
"The wings looks so amazing this year","VS"
"did u see what alessandra and lais wear! damn slay!!!","VS"
"Elsa's hair! <3","VS"
"me gustaria que hicieran un show o desfile en colombia","VS"
"don{t like the little wings","VS"
"Idk why VS isn't letting us know who opens this year like they usually do. I think Ale's gonna open the show this year. SHE NEEDS TO","VS"
"I love Stella with long hair 😍","VS"
"So that leaves Ale, Elsa, Martha, & Lais to open the show. Jo got Swarovski outfit but who knows, she has the chance to be chosen to open the show this year, and the Swarovski outfit could be her second outfit  in the Bright Night section","VS"
"Lias is literally STUNNING.","VS"
"Who`s opening the pink section ? Please tell me it is not one of these two bi... girls over rated Gigi or Kendall...","VS"
"The show isn't going to be the same without Candice and Behati since they are my favs and they are the models I look forward to seeing!","VS"
"Sophia is so f*cking annoying she is always loud n over the top, specially at 0:22, 0:51, 0:59 like wtf? she sounds like a goat in pain! 😑","VS"
"i wanna see Kardashian family walk on the runway! invie them please!","VS"
"Can anyone tell me if the vs fashion show is gonna be live on December 5th?","VS"
"lais body 👌👌👌👏👏😊👏","VS"
"martha's black and white boots dont really match with the outfit tbh😧","VS"
"Im so excited to watch the show! 🤗","VS"
"Will Taylor open  the VSFS?... someone said ""it's her first one ... ever"". It's not her first time opening a section, last year she opened the Pink section.","VS"
"Hey guys is it possible to be a part of this? how do you guys hire your design team or the photography team or any kind of job?","VS"
"Well, Adriana is pretty but maybe she needs a thinner waist and smile fix","VS"
"THIS VIDEO IS BETTER TAN THE CASTING ONE...","VS"
"the fantasy bra this year is freaking incredible, that outfit is to die for","VS"
"the fantasy bra outfit is beautiful! so much better than the fireworks one..","VS"
"OMG I can't wait for this year!!!!","VS"
"Stella opening a segment? Well that's gonna be boring","VS"
"Does anyone know the name of the song?","VS"
"I've noticed a lot of you don't like Adriana's outfit and thinks it sucks, well I highly disagree with you guys. Her look is very edgy and not on the commercial pretty side, that is why they gave it to her. Adriana has a very edgy strong look and she is able to pull these type of looks off with her eyes and bone structure! Adriana said herself that she likes edgy dark looks. I think that's why they always give her the edgy sharp looks because she likes it. she is not a girl that likes everything pretty!","VS"
"Candice just had a baby! How the hell does she do it ?","VS"
"I don't really like Lais' outfit","VS"
"BEHATI ?????????? <3 :/","VS"
"I see there are couple of rumors saying Elsa will open the show.I personally don't want her to!I don't get the hype about this girl at all.I really really really really pray Ale will open the show because damn,she has been in VS for 16 years and she has opened only once.And tbh,her opening back in 2009 was perfect,energetic and sexy!I am going to be disappointed if a NA open the show.They got way too many chances to shine this year while the older angels have been paid dust by VS.","VS"
"Adriana might not have the best outfit but damn she looks better than every other model with better outfits. Her body wow...","VS"
"I would love to see VS do something different with the hair. Like straighten the hair. It always looks the same.","VS"
"1:58 I felt that Adriana surprised about opening a section! She thought she might open the fashion show. Actually we do. Too long vsfs for seeing a perfect opening. Adriana is the show. Give it to ADRIANA!","VS"
"Strong rumors that Elsa will open the show.
Adriana will open Secret Angel and Sara close.
Lily will open Mountain Romance and Romee close.
Taylor will open Dark Angels.
Stella and Jasmine opens/closes Bright night Angel.

This is not 100% confirmed!","VS"
"Adriana needs MASSIVE wings, what the hell are these?!","VS"
"I hope Alessandra will open the show in this year.She deserves it more than everyone.","VS"
"lais deserves better i love her.","VS"
"Josephine is literally soo beautiful in this Swarovski outfit😍 Lais has a killer bombshell body and Adriana is the queen as always👑","VS"
"i feel bad for adriana, its okay u r the best!! u already get 3 fantasy bras and i always support u even when u r wearing a bad outfit this year","VS"
"Do you think VS is going to surprise us in the runway with Candice and Behati? 
Hope so! 
Creeis que VS nos va a sorprender en el desfile con Behati y Candice? 
Ojalaaaa son mis favoritas junto con Lily","VS"
"I think that it's a shame that they gave Adriana THIS outfit.","VS"
"So basically 
Elsa may have a very high chance to open the show with The Road Ahead. And I saw Ale's outfit is number 2 or 3 on the fitting board so Ale may not be closing the segment.
Lily A is opening Mountain Romance and Romee is closing it.
Taylor is opening Dark Angels
Adriana is opening Secret Angels and Sara is closing it
Stella is opening the final segment and Jasmine is closing it with the fantasy bra. 

A lot of fans are joking that Ale will be opening PINK section this year LOL","VS"
"no opening section for behati and candice this year. kinda sad.","VS"
"Does somebody know the song used?","VS"
"Lais doesn't looks happy  at all!!  Totally unfair for her... She deserves way better","VS"
"Thank God that Adriana is still here..","VS"
"What they are doing with all the wings after the show over?","VS"
"I'm so happy for Jasmin she deserves to wear the fantasy bra😊","VS"
"I've watched the VS Fashion show for years and... Why are these girls stick-thin this year? They usually have some curves and muscle... But this year they all look malnourished.","VS"
"Adriana opening and Alessandra closing the VSFS 🙌🏻 that is my dream?","VS"
"Lais and Elsa have been with y'all the longest out of all the new angels and yet they aren't opening anything...sad cause one is a bombshell while the other has such a great personality! Shane that neither are getting recognized","VS"
"stella is so pretty","VS"
"ESTE AÑO ESTA DISEÑADO PARA Q SE LUZCA ALESSANDRA AMBROSSIO COMO NUNCA.","VS"
"Am I the only one who loves Adriana 's outfit.?
I really like the mix of colors and how they look at it <3","VS"
"Sara 💟💟","VS"

A lot of fans are joking that Ale will be opening PINK section this year LOL","VS"
"no opening section for behati and candice this year. kinda sad.","VS"
"Does somebody know the song used?","VS"
"Lais doesn't looks happy  at all!!  Totally unfair for her... She deserves way better","VS"
"Thank God that Adriana is still here..","VS"
"What they are doing with all the wings after the show over?","VS"
"I'm so happy for Jasmin she deserves to wear the fantasy bra😊","VS"
"I've watched the VS Fashion show for years and... Why are these girls stick-thin this year? They usually have some curves and muscle... But this year they all look malnourished.","VS"
"Adriana opening and Alessandra closing the VSFS 🙌🏻 that is my dream?","VS"
"Lais and Elsa have been with y'all the longest out of all the new angels and yet they aren't opening anything...sad cause one is a bombshell while the other has such a great personality! Shane that neither are getting recognized","VS"
"stella is so pretty","VS"
"ESTE AÑO ESTA DISEÑADO PARA Q SE LUZCA ALESSANDRA AMBROSSIO COMO NUNCA.","VS"

"I don't even know why (please don't hate me) but I feel like Taylor is really snobby & not nice at all, fake almost-  that's just the vibe she gives off to me, not trying to be rude or anything just my opinion ❤️","VS"
"Someone tell why they have to look like sticks  why won't they have a plus size line that's not fair","VS"

"She is definitely good. My previous favourite VS angel was Miranda Kerr, now is Taylor.","VS"
"I feel like Taylor almost has a natural body.","VS"
"Guys why are you fighting so much and saying that you just want to see Alessandra and Adriana and Candice? Guys they are growing up so fast and they want to do more and VS has to find new talents and new faces and we have to have opportunities to this awesome and beautiful woman, by the way.. I just want to be like them or better if God give me the life to do it, but in life I'm gonna fight for this and you gonna remember me saying this, who's dreaming with this? Tell me, I wanna be your friend lets goooooo! Woooooo!","VS"
"I don't know, this video just doesn't inspire me as much as other 'Road to Runway' videos, I think that's because she's got  a little bit  'don't care' attitiude, maybe because her position in brand is very strong and some people consider her as a future of it","VS"
"I love you Taylor!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 Beautiful as always!!!!!!!","VS"
"She really has something that makes her kill the runway each time she's walking","VS"
"LUV U TAYLOR HILL ❤️❤️❤️","VS"
"My favorite among the young angels.","VS"

Bellas more of a high fashion model. Kendall should just stick to insta.","VS"

"Dear Josephine, you're not breathing romance and love, you're breathing pollution sweetie","VS"
"Omg I'm a really short girl whose dream is to model in VS and girls like Kendall and Gigi just are there for ratings? That's super unfair for people who actually want to be models and are upstaged by by the famous stars who just see it as a hobby. Like if you agree","VS"
"2016 was the worst show! It went downhill after 2013 and Kendall Jenner should not have been there at all.","VS"

"Honestly it's so sad seeing all of these hate comments directed at Kendall , Gigi and Bella . Some of you are acting like they're the worst girls on Earth . Yeah they come from rich families but they also do still work hard . Some of you think that they aren't "" real "" models well guess what ? If they weren't real models then they wouldn't be on the cover of magazines or walking in fashion week . Stop acting like everything that they do is because if they're families , yeah some parents do have to pay for things to be done but honestly those girls work just as hard as all the other models , don't judge them or hate on them because of what you see on tv and social media because you don't truly know how they are as a person in reality . Kendall Jenner , Jelena "" Gigi "" Hadid and Isabella ""Bella"" Hadid are in fact real models so get over it .","VS"
"I would not like it if gigi, kendall and bella become angels","VS"
"Lol Chanel is doing each one of their shows in the Grand Palais (apart form the Cruises and the Métiers d'Art) with a lot crazier venues than just a runway, and no one talks about it, because it seems so normal as it is Chanel. This just proves so much why Chanel rules the fashion and luxury industry.","VS"
"they are going to slay on the fashion show","VS"
"I think it's amazing to have the fashion show in Paris, but the show in my opinion had missed many opportunities with the creative decisions made. Paris is known for high end clothing (such as lingerie), why not base your designs for the show on that?! Like what about French lace? 
The show was all over the place with the costumes. It just felt like someone was like ""let's do an Asian theme in a European country"". The theme felt lazy, which is a shame considering all the hard work and time models and crew put into it and all of the possible ideas.","VS"
"wtf.... I think the models are amazing. But this industry is bullshit. Girls should be more. We are not here to be loved by people just because we look good. And the comments... How can you guys just say ""This models are not good enough, they are uglier than the older models."" Who tf are you to say this? They are all amazing and no one has the right to judge. But this industry, fucked up. Women and men, everyone is beautiful.","VS"
"OMG I COULD NE ONE. Like seurosly of Adriana and Ale werent there the show will be a complete mess","VS"

"Honestly it's so sad seeing all of these hate comments directed at Kendall , Gigi and Bella . Some of you are acting like they're the worst girls on Earth . Yeah they come from rich families but they also do still work hard . Some of you think that they aren't "" real "" models well guess what ? If they weren't real models then they wouldn't be on the cover of magazines or walking in fashion week . Stop acting like everything that they do is because if they're families , yeah some parents do have to pay for things to be done but honestly those girls work just as hard as all the other models , don't judge them or hate on them because of what you see on tv and social media because you don't truly know how they are as a person in reality . Kendall Jenner , Jelena "" Gigi "" Hadid and Isabella ""Bella"" Hadid are in fact real models so get over it .","VS"

"I think it's amazing to have the fashion show in Paris, but the show in my opinion had missed many opportunities with the creative decisions made. Paris is known for high end clothing (such as lingerie), why not base your designs for the show on that?! Like what about French lace? 
The show was all over the place with the costumes. It just felt like someone was like ""let's do an Asian theme in a European country"". The theme felt lazy, which is a shame considering all the hard work and time models and crew put into it and all of the possible ideas.","VS"
"wtf.... I think the models are amazing. But this industry is bullshit. Girls should be more. We are not here to be loved by people just because we look good. And the comments...

Hopefully next year they make sure there's a reasonable amount of models so the runway isn't so busy and the whole thing doesn't seem rushed, last year away amazing and so were many before that. This year just didn't do it for me 😕","VS"

It's not a female host thing either...I've seen female hosts on other shows that are totally cool/ normal/ funny with these models.","VS"
"31:23 ""you can't just wake up and walk into the casting"" probably what Kendall and Gigi did...all because of their idiotic families. All the girls on here are 100x the wannabe instagram models that are Kendall and Gigi and Bella. What a complete waste of 3 slots.","VS"

Honestly, is kinda dramatic how they say Adriana threw another model into the audience, and they made it seem like Adriana did it purposedly, unless they were talking about an ""Adrianna"" with double N's, who was maybe a staff member, though I doubt it; but I'm sure Adriana Lima the supermodel didn't throw anyone into the audience during the Fashion Show...","VS"
"Gawd, Elsa Hosk is gorgeous ♥","VS"
"Please fire the host she's rude awkward seems jealous and attempts to always find something to put them down.","VS"

"Please change the host","VS"
"why are we all calling all women guys? it seems weird i""m not a guy","VS"
"I'm pretty disappointed in VS, you give all the white and black models all the shine and asian models like Liu Wen and Sui He that have walked the runway for more then 7 years have not wore the fantasy bra or gotten any type of  spotlight from you what especially gets me upset is that models like Gigi Hadid  that have walked the runway once got more attention","VS"
"2:37 that was so awkward omg kill me","VS"
"where is Kendall??","VS"
"Monica is a bitter host, not polite to angels really. Maybe she can try to be a model so she will be happy","VS"
"I'm from Sweden myself, and it annoys me that Elsa cant say ""crush"", I mean its pronounced crush and not ""crash"". Seriously, swedes knows this.","VS"
"Please don't let Monica host next year. Please.","VS"
"They need to get a new interviewer! This woman has no charisma...... so boring. Please please get Ryan Seacrest or someone!","VS"

"Monica really brings the light, happy vibe of the show down. A pre-show should set us up for the actual show... get us hyped up and excited for it. She seems condescending and a bit mean. Her demeanor works for a VP but seems inappropriate here.","VS"
"damn they are hot heard the wings are heavy ad hell","VS"

"I have HONESTLY been to a race track and seen better looking heads on a horse than these anorexic women.","VS"
"This host is so...egh please stop, too awkward...She kind of has a look on her face like she doesn't want to seem jealous but can't help it, and at the same time is making side comments that are passive aggressive bitchy. It's not a female host thing either...I've seen female hosts on other shows that are totally cool/ normal/ funny with these models.","VS"
"31:23 ""you can't just wake up and walk into the casting"" probably what Kendall and Gigi did...all because of their idiotic families. All the girls on here are 100x the wannabe instagram models that are Kendall and Gigi and Bella. What a complete waste of 3 slots.","VS"
"lol i think she is doing a good job. its not like a real tv show anyway. isnt Monica their boss? i think she is. and she is older than them, she wouldnt be interested in their stories. She is being nice for a woman in her position, in my opinion.","VS"

"I am not skinny! I am not fat! I am in the middle and by looking at VS models I was convinced that I am so incredibly fat compared to them!!! But after nearly killing myself I lost a lot of weight due to the motivation! But like 5 min ago I was standing looking at myself in the mirror looking at the waist I have got now and I was like : "" B*tch I don't flipping care what everyone else thinks!

"Fucking hoebagg you better be nice to Elsa next time","VS"
"@erinheathertonlegit @elsahosk Erin, Elsa, how is this medically relevant? 

what about revenge is better served cold. That wasn't revenge. I just don't want to be around them. There's no forgiveness for delaying me by several years. My mother or father has been manipulating my legal information for their own uses, and has no relevance to medical. 4 years of my career was wasted on jobs which was not relevant to medical just because they didn't think I had it, yet they kept insulting about showing off. It was about control. Don't bring my parents, or sister up. 

Anyway how is this medically relevant? Her breasts? There's no tumor or breast cancer. Breasts with tumors do not look like that. And she'd be in a hospital. Not everyone who has cancer cuts their hair. The hair loss is often from nutritional from the tumor or chemotherapy.","VS"
"ok her French was terrible was so terrible I couldn't tell what she was saying and I studied French all my life","VS"

"She is really special, one of the top angels, the top of the top. She's almost unbeatable in terms of runway presence and walking skills, her show opening was the best in the history of VS, only Karlie, Magdalena, Taylor, Adriana, and maybe Sara can come close to her perfection. And in terms of beauty only Candice, Romee, Lais, Stella, Cindy and Lily Donaldson are able to be named in her level. She really is one of the top of the 7 billion humans on earth. You know she is going to stay in people's memory as one of the greatest models and as one of the greatest angels this world had.","VS"

"Look! A king+ will reign for righteousness,+
And princes will rule for justice.
 2 And each one will be like a hiding place* from the wind,
A place of concealment* from the rainstorm,
Like streams of water in a waterless land,+
Like the shadow of a massive crag in a parched land.
 3 Then the eyes of those seeing will no longer be pasted shut,
And the ears of those hearing will pay attention.
 4 The heart of those who are impetuous will ponder over knowledge,
And the stammering tongue will speak fluently and clearly.+
 5 The senseless one will no longer be called generous,
And the unprincipled man will not be called noble;
 6 For the senseless one will speak nonsense,
And his heart will devise harmful things,+
To promote apostasy* and to speak what is wayward against Jehovah,
To cause the hungry one* to go unfed
And to deprive the thirsty one of something to drink.
 7 The devices of the unprincipled man are bad;+
He promotes shameful conduct
To ruin the afflicted one with lies,+
Even when the poor speaks what is right.
 8 But the generous one has generous intentions,
And in generous* endeavors he perseveres.
 9 “You complacent women, get up and listen to my voice!
You carefree daughters,+ pay attention to what I say!
10 In a little over a year, you who are carefree will shudder,
Because no fruit will have been gathered when the grape harvest ends.+
11 Tremble, you complacent women!
Shudder, you who are carefree!
Strip yourselves bare,
And put sackcloth around your hips.+
12 Beat your breasts in lamentation
Over the desirable fields and the fruitful vine.
13 For the ground of my people will be covered with thorns and briars;
They will cover all the houses of rejoicing,
Yes, the city of exultation.+
14 For the fortified tower has been forsaken;
The noisy city has been abandoned.+
Oʹphel+ and the watchtower have become a permanent wasteland,
A delight for wild donkeys,
A pasture for the flocks,+
15 Until the spirit is poured out on us from above,+
And the wilderness becomes an orchard,
And the orchard is regarded as a forest.+
16 Then justice will reside in the wilderness,
And righteousness will dwell in the orchard.+
17 The result of true righteousness will be peace,+
And the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquillity and security.+
18 My people will dwell in a peaceful abiding place,
In secure dwellings and in tranquil resting-places.+
19 But the hail will flatten the forest,
And the city will be completely leveled.
20 Happy are you who sow seed alongside all waters,
Who send out* the bull and the donkey.”+","VS"

"YASSSSS SARA YASS","VS"
"I have an idea about next years fantasy bra. Next year is going to be 40 years VS. This is really special, so the fantasy bra should be and be worn special. I just thought: even not the most expensive bra, the Royal of Candice, was 10 millions worth. There are actually so many angels, and what would be even more amazing, models like Izabel, Lily Donaldson or Maria Borges, who really did so much for VS, who would deserve to wear the Fantasy Bra. So at the end, there are like 10 angels and models who really would deserve this. So I thought that you could do one segment only composed of Fantasy Bras, each angel or model wearing one worth around 1 million. It would have the same cost as the one of Candice and would be really history making. Dear VS, please think about it.","VS"

"FINAllY victoria reach an first world city.","VS"
"奚梦瑶、何穗、刘雯、雎晓雯都超美","VS"
"Since the title says ""Victoria's Secret ANGELS Land in China"", Ale and Josephine are already angels which means Ming Xi and Sui He are probably angels since the title says ""Angels Land in China"". So I'm guessing they're going to be angels and most likely Liu Wen might be wearing the Fantasy Bra, she was the first asian model to be in the Victoria Secret Fashion Show, and since Victoria Secret is coming to China. Liu Wen might have the opportunity to wear the fantasy bra.","VS"
"Sui He and Ming Xi are definitely going to be angels in 2017, Liu Wen might. IDK but Ming Xi is like obviously going to be angel","VS"
"Smeh yeah they love China yet they invite Gigi lol?","VS"
"Ming Xi must be one of the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life","VS"

"Alessandra is such a goddess!","VS"
"Victoria's Secret says: 'We ♥ China'; but they haven't picked a chinese top model for being one of the official VS angels, like for example Sui He or Ming Xi...","VS"
"In my opinion, among the prominent Chinese runway models, Ming Xi fits as a VS Angel. What set her a part are her bubbly personality and high energy. And she is fluent in English.","VS"
"I love how some people are getting all political in the comments and missing all of the fun in the video <3","VS"
"Ming Xi  ♥ ❤","VS"

It's an imperfect analogy because Dr. Cox is an alcoholic in his private life. I am not alcoholic and he's a fictional character representing an internal medicine physician. The general idea is  once doctor's start blaming themselves, they fall apart because they're near the the dead and dying all the time. I have already watch all episodes of scrubs.

Conception being defined as the time point the sperm fuses with the oocyte forming the zygote. Very specific changes in both the mother and father occur. It attaches itself to wall of the body of the fundus of the mother, where the zygote develops into embryo in the first 1-6 days. After the 3rd week of development the embryo is visible on SPECIFICALLY fetal ultrasound settings. The first 3 months, or trimester being the most critical. I actually studied. It has to be very special nutrition in the first 3 months. As I stated I am a trained sonographer. Messing with me is like messing with the neonatal nurses and pediatricians.","VS"

And Ina she had previous boyfriends before me. She wanted to do me what her previous boyfriends did to her. That was the criminal motivation and intent, and enough for indictment. 

Therefore no charges should be dropped against her, or against Felix. 

Furthermore, someone periodically tried to shock me with electricity in my first months. That's another reason for the hair loss.

"@erinheathertonlegit 

Someone tried to spread rumors about firing you or being fired

about what's been occurring the abuse to me and my body, physically : ethical media is about prospective 

- Medical practice, nutritional practice, harmful information
- Error, decision-making, judgement, prejudice, malicious intent -> physical scar, emotional scar  

- Parents criticism -> you said yes: My response: You offered and I trusted you, I trusted your words. 
- External interference -> friend, coworker, 
- Media: Movies, News, articles: medical evidence for criminal intent | scarface 

Evidence: my scars from birth, and new scars in the recent years, wrinkles. 

I will have received full compensate when I have 0 scars, and 0 wrinkles. 

About the time Mrs. Lorraine Ware tried to diagnose me with a host of psychiatric disorders, syndromes, and illnesses, my father beat me. 

The difference is at 6 or 7 years old, I wasn't 5'9 - 6'1. I was 4 ft then and not able to lift 360 lbs or more lower, and 100 lbs or more upper. Also, I wasn't trained or educated on United Nations, Republic of Korea, United States government policies, or Geneva policies at 6 or 7 years old.

While I was in L.A., in that weight room, I was assessing my upper or healthy maximum. The photos are clearly in my cell phone. At the time it was for Ultrasound job related. They, my former classmates, or others looked for every possible method to eliminate me from the ultrasound profession. I am their superior, their manager. 

My mentality was different then. There were the news of hate crimes during elections, violence and other issues, political instability atypical to a Developed Country. 

There was also ultrasound machines used for harmful intent, illegally purchased, or stolen (not Samsung) in the news which should of been noticed by the ethics board of sonography. Those stolen ultrasound machines should of been retrieved by law enforcement in the country it was pirated from. 

Its their pride, a 27-28 old able to carry on the responsibilities of veteran in the medical profession. It is because I was trained by veterans. 

I chose not to work in ultrasound in case there were sexual assault claims, sexual harassment, or other risks. All of it has to align.

Erin I am not just making it up. This is multi-tasking. President Trump, President Moon, President Rousseff, and courts will ensure it is completed. This is what changed. North Korea performed their first hydrogen testing even before and released the news at a specific time.

Between Time-Sport Illustrated-Sport Illustrated, they will or could be charged with conglomerate, monopolistic activity, interfering with medical data costing the lives of patients or homicide and mass murder. That is the CEO or individual responsible for making the specific decisions void of ethical responsibilities or consequences with indictment for life in prison, employees involved will be charged with $1 billion dollars for each country (both U.S.D.-Won-Centavos) over a 5 year term as they were following orders of upper management, with the exception of the models as they are primary or at greatest risk of harm. That is what could happen. 

Medical evidence is harm at the genetic level in the isles, islands, and regions surrounding the site of Fukushima radiation leaks, nuclear testing by North Korea and environmental radiation runoff. As people depend on plants or animals for food, pathology in plants or animals is transmitted to people. 

If Erin or related models are sent to a region with increased radiation or accumulation of radiation, they will experience radiation sickness. It is no different from a medical professional, criminals do attempt to target or harm medical professionals using radiation. 

There is already damage to the ozone layer here. The sun is more intense. The income of female models to male models offsets the gender inequality female models experience in comparison to male models.

Any extra money Grinnell College SGA received, i.e. for Invisible Children fundraising, someone else intervened on the budget and spent it on partying and other expenses. I did not approve nor was I notified. 

I was too busy or tired.

It's an imperfect analogy because Dr. Cox is an alcoholic in his private life. I am not alcoholic and he's a fictional character representing an internal medicine physician. The general idea is  once doctor's start blaming themselves, they fall apart because they're near the the dead and dying all the time. I have already watch all episodes of scrubs.

"@erinheathertonlegit why are they trying to remind me of embryonic development? Zona pellucida, it's a specific region in the oocyte, protected, until a specific sperm fuses with the oocyte to form the zygote which divides repeatedly forming the embryo after specific number of days from conception. Conception being defined as the time point the sperm fuses with the oocyte forming the zygote. Very specific changes in both the mother and father occur. It attaches itself to wall of the body of the fundus of the mother, where the zygote develops into embryo in the first 1-6 days. After the 3rd week of development the embryo is visible on SPECIFICALLY fetal ultrasound settings. The first 3 months, or trimester being the most critical. I actually studied. It has to be very special nutrition in the first 3 months. As I stated I am a trained sonographer. Messing with me is like messing with the neonatal nurses and pediatricians.","VS"

And Ina she had previous boyfriends before me. She wanted to do me what her previous boyfriends did to her. That was the criminal motivation and intent, and enough for indictment. 

Therefore no charges should be dropped against her, or against Felix. 

Furthermore, someone periodically tried to shock me with electricity in my first months. That's another reason for the hair loss.

"@erinheathertonlegit 

Someone tried to spread rumors about firing you or being fired

about what's been occurring the abuse to me and my body, physically : ethical media is about prospective 

- Medical practice, nutritional practice, harmful information
- Error, decision-making, judgement, prejudice, malicious intent -> physical scar, emotional scar  

- Parents criticism -> you said yes: My response: You offered and I trusted you, I trusted your words. 
- External interference -> friend, coworker, 
- Media: Movies, News, articles: medical evidence for criminal intent | scarface 

Evidence: my scars from birth, and new scars in the recent years, wrinkles. 

I will have received full compensate when I have 0 scars, and 0 wrinkles. 

About the time Mrs. Lorraine Ware tried to diagnose me with a host of psychiatric disorders, syndromes, and illnesses, my father beat me. 

The difference is at 6 or 7 years old, I wasn't 5'9 - 6'1. I was 4 ft then and not able to lift 360 lbs or more lower, and 100 lbs or more upper. Also, I wasn't trained or educated on United Nations, Republic of Korea, United States government policies, or Geneva policies at 6 or 7 years old.

While I was in L.A., in that weight room, I was assessing my upper or healthy maximum. The photos are clearly in my cell phone. At the time it was for Ultrasound job related. They, my former classmates, or others looked for every possible method to eliminate me from the ultrasound profession. I am their superior, their manager. 

My mentality was different then. There were the news of hate crimes during elections, violence and other issues, political instability atypical to a Developed Country. 

There was also ultrasound machines used for harmful intent, illegally purchased, or stolen (not Samsung) in the news which should of been noticed by the ethics board of sonography. Those stolen ultrasound machines should of been retrieved by law enforcement in the country it was pirated from. 

Its their pride, a 27-28 old able to carry on the responsibilities of veteran in the medical profession. It is because I was trained by veterans. 

I chose not to work in ultrasound in case there were sexual assault claims, sexual harassment, or other risks. All of it has to align.

Erin I am not just making it up. This is multi-tasking. President Trump, President Moon, President Rousseff, and courts will ensure it is completed. This is what changed. North Korea performed their first hydrogen testing even before and released the news at a specific time.

Between Time-Sport Illustrated-Sport Illustrated, they will or could be charged with conglomerate, monopolistic activity, interfering with medical data costing the lives of patients or homicide and mass murder. That is the CEO or individual responsible for making the specific decisions void of ethical responsibilities or consequences with indictment for life in prison, employees involved will be charged with $1 billion dollars for each country (both U.S.D.-Won-Centavos) over a 5 year term as they were following orders of upper management, with the exception of the models as they are primary or at greatest risk of harm. That is what could happen. 

Medical evidence is harm at the genetic level in the isles, islands, and regions surrounding the site of Fukushima radiation leaks, nuclear testing by North Korea and environmental radiation runoff. As people depend on plants or animals for food, pathology in plants or animals is transmitted to people. 

If Erin or related models are sent to a region with increased radiation or accumulation of radiation, they will experience radiation sickness. It is no different from a medical professional, criminals do attempt to target or harm medical professionals using radiation. 

There is already damage to the ozone layer here. The sun is more intense. The income of female models to male models offsets the gender inequality female models experience in comparison to male models.

She's so beautiful and keeps it real. She's just a very beautiful and genuine person both on the inside and the outside. I really wish VS would cast Stella more and we could see more of her. She's got a heart of gold and loves her puppy so much. You can frequently judge the character of a person by how they treat animals. Stella is Stellar!","VS"

"Hi, I’m Sarah Aschoff and I’m 17 years old. I have been obsessed with watching the Victoria Secret Fashion show for as long as I can remember. It gives me such joy to see all the beautiful costumes and it gets me especially excited for the holidays! What I’ve noticed, however, is that all the girls, although drop dead gorgeous, are 5’11 and practically goddesses. What I would absolutely love to see is some diversity in the chosen models. Especially in the eyes of younger girls, it is so pivotal for them to look up to girls from all shapes and sizes. It is such a fragile moment for them in their childhood years, whether that be 6 or 17, to be exposed to an overwhelming influential brand as Victoria’s Secret. And when they see all of the same type of women walking the runways, it really makes young girls feel as though that is exactly who they must be and look like in order to be beautiful. But in reality beauty comes in all forms. And real beauty is found in everyone, because we are all human and that’s something that is so uniquely beautiful on its own.","VS"

This is what will get me to buy lingerie (and I sure am buying it), a sexy sensual woman not a goofy girl that looks like a teenager. Seeing the lingerie on a body like Adriana's is so much more relatable then seeing it on Stella for example. This is what I wanna see!","VS"

"umm ... the advice is a little off. 
1- Your body needs at least 1 day to recover, especially if you are doing workouts with high intensity and weight training. Now, you can have an active recovery day where you go walking or do yoga but not having a day off at all will harm your muscles.
2- Carrying on extra weights in your luggage when you travel? I'd rather not. Even Alessandra was like o_O ""really?"" but manged to brush it off quick ( 2:00 - 2:06 ) - you can opt for resistance bands or booty bands! or sliding discs. Those things will not even way half of what she said and they work your entire body and you can use them practically anywhere! and if you don't know what to do with them or how to use them, YOUTUBE! ;D","VS"
"So gorgeous. I love the train like an angel hype this time every year, also I'm loving the muted tones of those sports bras I must have one! <33","VS"
"Ale's ears?🤔🤔🤔","VS"
"For all the guys saying this is Bullshit - shut up. This is VS Angel level, not for some school girl with highest aim to get a flat belly","VS"
"Miranda y Candice no trabajan más para VS????","VS"
"WRONG!!  Your body does need a rest 1 day a week and that is straight from your Creator  God.  Commandment # 4.  A reason to rest Thank God!!!","VS"
"I want to train like an angel but I eat like a monster lol (i will train since today!)","VS"
"how is she a vs model her ear look like mr.potatoe chip ears","VS"
"REST or NAP when you have an alarm to set for a mental nap.","VS"
"Alessandra kept interrupting the trainer which was hard to listen to","VS"
"This is bullshit  - according to all pt:s and doctors and experts within health and exercise, 3 days a week of intense exercises is more than enough, if you are active the other 4 days with just walking to work or just being active in a non - exercising way, thats more than fine. 

Then ofc, if you have a certain goal, you might have to work out more - but just to keep yourself  in a healthy way, 3 days are enough - or 20 - 30 min a day. But you dont have to work out intense. And for the record, to not have a day off is not good for your body, it needs to rest. Experts say themselves that at least 2 days off a week is neccessary if you want to get the best results with your body and health. 

Everyone is not a VS angel, you guys should consider this when making videos like these.","VS"
"What an unrealistic advice! I've been running once or twice a week since April, started as a total slob and now I can run a half-marathon. Working 9to5, learning photography on side. Young girls should not be served this kind of bullshit. You can get results without being at the gym 7 times a week for 60 minutes. Seriously, who's got time for that! Nutrition plays a big role, predominantly whole foods diet is the key.","VS"

"LOL! She's a tranny that went out of the closet and called herself Sam last year(check out her own Snapchats around August 2016). I might not have a problem with that if she was honest about it from the beginning(there would have been a clear choice on if you are interested to know her person or not under such circumstances), but doing it this way had me repulsed and disgusted on her and her two-faced nature. I guess that was the secret she allegedly kept privy. I trust less people who are all smiles since then, too.","VS"
"I'm pretty disappointed in VS, you give all the white and black models all the shine and asian models like Liu Wen and Sui He that have walked the runway  for more then 7 years have not wore the fantasy bra or gotten any type of  spotlight from you","VS"

"Love your hairstyle Martha^^","VS"
"I honestly love Martha, she is truly amazing, but I think that they should have done the ballet beautiful slash VS videos with Candice. She did ballet for many years, and she has it in her still. I know Martha is working hard and I praise her for it, but there's something that a non dancer can't capture, like the arms, the wrists, the posture. She is truly beautiful, but Candice would do this better.","VS"

"Thank you Mary Helen for saying that it's normal that one side of the body is more open than the other :) I was worried I did something wrong.","VS"
"The model is so unflexible it’s bad","VS"

"Martha's legs are so long and skinny","VS"
"i am so glad I started doing ballet.","VS"
"Martha is too skinny ;/","VS"
"we need more of this type of classical trainings and I think it is really good for the selfconfidence and posture","VS"
"Wtf? I thought martha's body was a little more curvy","VS"
"Martha has the perfect body damn.","VS"
"Omg I have that same bump on the back of my neck, finally can relate to a VS angel 😂","VS"
"Hideous that angels get used for ‘ballet adverts’ and to promote ballet.. this isn’t even frikkin ballet and people actually think it is 😤","VS"
"Martha is so perfect","VS"
"Lol why is it the angels say they work out but martha can't even touch her toes? If you train so 'hard', do ballet on a daily basis, wouldn't you be able to do so? I'm a heptathlete and I can touch my toes, and I don't even do ballet. Plus Martha didn't have her leg flat on the ground during the first stretch. So much for training like an angel","VS"
"Martha has a special beautiful face and her skin is so perfect","VS"
"Love Martha, but they should have done the ballet stuff with Candace","VS"
"Love ballet beautiful","VS"

"definitely go see a urologist! I know it sounds uncomfortable (but patients tell me its not as bad as they expected!). What worries me about intermittent symptoms of a UTI is that if not treated (which is what often happens when the pain and discomfort waxes and wanes), the bacterial infection can travel up the urethra to the bladder, and even up the ureters to the kidneys to cause pyelonephritis (which can be dangerous for many reasons and also extremely painful). In the mean time, continue to drink lots of water and also add cranberry juice to your diet because it has a knack for flushing the bacteria out of your system. But this mostly helps the SYMPTOMS, and can prevent future infections, but does not treat and active infection, so please go see a doctor! So sorry you're going through this, utis are so painful and uncomfortable :( Love you and your videos and your overall message! xoxo","VS"

"So relieved to see Candice!! I am bored of seeing Sara's face on everything... Unpopular opinion, i think she is definitely a beautiful face however i feel she is an obvious beauty there is no mystery behind her, i have spent the last week casting models myself and it is very hard to find that mysterious element in models, but for the Angels like Adriana, Candice, Alessandra, Lais they have that come hither allure appeal of young at heart but mature all the same. For me Sara doesn't have that full Victoria's Secret package it could be her height that throws me as well. For me the perfect representation of an Angel is this goddess of amazonic proportions and a face that cannot be found in others so easy. I see plenty of girls with Sara's facial features, drop dead gorgeous and beautiful yes but not particularly singular. Just my opinion","VS"

"I see Candice, I click","VS"
"Mi sueño frustrado :v😁","VS"
"So relieved to see Candice!! I am bored of seeing Sara's face on everything... Unpopular opinion, i think she is definitely a beautiful face however i feel she is an obvious beauty there is no mystery behind her, i have spent the last week casting models myself and it is very hard to find that mysterious element in models, but for the Angels like Adriana, Candice, Alessandra, Lais they have that come hither allure appeal of young at heart but mature all the same. For me Sara doesn't have that full Victoria's Secret package it could be her height that throws me as well. For me the perfect representation of an Angel is this goddess of amazonic proportions and a face that cannot be found in others so easy. I see plenty of girls with Sara's facial features, drop dead gorgeous and beautiful yes but not particularly singular. Just my opinion","VS"
"my Candice is back!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍","VS"

Ce fus mon meilleur somnifère. 30 octobre 21h58'","VS"

"Mi vida se dulce ella!😍","VS"
"If the fantasy bra is made for her body then she would have already had to get crazy specific measurements to make sure it fit perfectly meaning she would have known before the bra was even finished so the reaction has to be fake. But she is really beautiful and deserves the honour.","VS"

"Her complexion is gorgeous! Even without makeup & lighting (which makes her skin look more glowy/dewy) she's a natural beauty!

Last year I swear they had 2 segments which both used very similar black flowy, silky materials and the 2 segments were almost next to each other.

Victoria's Secret you need to push your creative team and stop renaming already used ideas.","VS"

"How is it that even after the calendar collection from 2014(?) and all the native-american-thanksgiving-model-cut problem, they still try to have a big native-american wing on a model's back??? Im really curious as to how many backlashes this might get after the airing of the show....  2:24","VS"

"Skinny and thin is real and womanly who are you guys to say what model bodies or anyone's body are supposed to look like? This is the standard now, get over it just because you're jealous and want the body! Men love this and women want this so trolling won't change a thing. People have different bodies, thin is beautiful get over it. Degrading certain women because they look different and are the standard in just low. First of all some people are born this way and LOVE being skinny and healthy, I for one do and wont change it for the world. Obese women are so bitter these days, skinny shaming and trolling, why won't you guys get a life and stop hating. Just be happy for people, being negative won't get you anywhere. All women don't have curves and all women don't want them men like what they like and beautiful is beautiful curves or not. So we are supposed to just act like skinny women don't exsist and make ""curvy"" uhem fat women the standard because of jealousy? This is probably why skinny women are the standard in the first place because they were being shit on and then the modeling industry boomed and gave the world a chance to see our beauty. So long ""curvy"" women said they were the standard and then other bodies got showcased and people seen rare beauty that can't be obtained by everyone then people fell in love especially men. People were tired of seeing the same thing. Stop trying to make obese happen by being outraged and forcing companies to but fat women in their clothes. I can see how insecure big women are through a computer screen by all the social media pages trying to promote rolls, skinny shaming women, trying to promote ""body positivity"", saying how wrong body shaming is just to turn around and do it to skinny/thin/slim women. So body shaming only applies to fat women? Okay not fat men or skinny people? Okay nice try smh...","VS"

"ming xi had the long fabric outfit, which is hard to walk with, and, she was so into interaction so as to forget WALKING STEADY is PRIORITY, she looked like she didn’t have enough muscle and balance to control her body to not shaking as a Professional model, so she looked kind of flowing and held no strong points on the ball of her feet..btw, i saw she was in 4 tv real life shows, 2 movies, even represented certain chinese online small game this year...good lord, I thought she was not a model anymore, I mean everybody’s energy and time is not infinite. So well you know you harvest what you plant. I have sympathy on her but she is not as professional this year compare to last couple years. Maybe she got over hyped since shanghai is her hometown and she forgot she is not in real life tvshow anymore she needs to handle the situation instead of smiling awkwardly which probably makes things funny and entertaining in real life tv shows, but sorry not on runway when you are trying to display the outfit not your personal dance...","VS"

And Alessandra is leaving the brand, and we're only left with Candice, Adriana and Behati (but she doesn't walk this year). The artists choice are terrible except for Harry Styles. Overall, the brand has been going downhill since 2016. 

And the new angel is lack of energy, the only one I liked is Sara, Elsa, Jasmine and Josephine. Everybody hating on Taylor because she's racist but I'm here just be like she have a boring walk.

Maybe Candice & Behati becoming a South African Lims & Ale duo for the brand in later years. Ming Xi (despite the infamous fall which better not air), Grace Elizabeth, Zuri Tibby, Alana Arrington, Rachel Hilbert, Maggie, and especially DILONE becoming newbie angels. PINK being opened by a model of color like Dilone or Zuri for the first time ever. Better themes, Crazier wings, More wings for PINK, Crazier Segments, and even more relevant music acts. TBH I lowkey swore Dua Lipa was gonna get the show since she's like the most played female artist this year next to Cardi B..

"VSFS producers need to start listening to their viewers. Gone are the days where the VS Angels were iconic women with household names. The Angels of today lack individuality and recognition. You can't tell one from the rest, and the girls seem to be getting thinner every year. I'm not skinny shaming, but VS used to be known for having healthy/fit, curvy looking women walking down the runway. Even the costumes do not stun the way they used to (2017 being particularly boring). VSFS is in need of a serious overhaul.","VS"
"Bro.....lmfaooooooooooooo!!!!!!

The music to this video has me dying, I feel like I'm watching the first 48 lmfaoooookkkk
I notice, the skinnier the model, the more they need people to shout at them to actually do their job, like smile at the camera bitch and eat some Whataburger looking ass hoes. All this plastic surgery and cocaine, waste, and all these bitches have pouty lips, wtf Victoria's Secret? Aren't small lipped women beautiful too, which y'all would include in fashion also? And these girls, the ones too skinny, is the fashion world's fault, don't starve to death to be beautiful, fucking BULLSHIT.","VS"

"Wow, that Balmain/Victoria Secret collabration is so hideous and ugly! :o The models if it wasn't for their beauty and their walks, that would have been a complete wreck. I was assuming based on the clothes I have seen Balmain create, it would be something incredible but it was trash. When I saw Candice's outfit, all I was thinking about how I can get that bra in Walmart for $5, it looked so cheap and terrible! That was not justice for the models!","VS"
"I hope not all the good one’s is going to retire. Who’s going to replace them? Hadid sisters and kendal...? trash, trash, TRASH!","VS"

"harry steals the show from all the models sorry!!! 😍😍","VS"
"THE WORST SHOW EVER
I love VS fashion show, I'm a huuge fan of all the models, following them on social media and everything. I was so hyped and excited about the show..but, I have watched it and I'm just disappointed..
And what's wrong? First of all, the line up..
Take a circus section in 2012. for example, Adriana opening the show was legendary, and then Miranda Kerr, Doutzen Kroes, Candice, Erin Heatherton, Izabel Goulart, Karlie Kloss.. Every girl on that runway was a PRO, show stopper, absolutely gorgeous.
All VS models were pros, veterans and huge names in fashion industry.  Small time models were only walking in pink section for at least 4 years before the main one. Behati Prinsloo has been in pink for 5 years, all together 11 years in Victoria's secret and still haven't gotten the fantasy bra. Behati opened one section after 6 years on runway. And what happened last year? Jasmine Tookes was wearing fantasy bra, and she's been in VS for only 5 years at a time!!  Fantasy bra was set to be worn by the greatest models of Victoria's secret, not practically a newby. 
This year was 55 models in the show, In my opinion VS was just fine with 30,40 models when all of them were fantastic professionals.  Ming Xi falling was just pathetic, and Sanne Vloet almost fell  when she posed at the end of the runway which is hilarious. Many girls were just blowing kisses, or striking some awkward newby poses, and you can clearly see that they are scared and shaking, like VS is out of their league. VS models should be fierce,confident,powerful, and breathtaking, and those are only a few left.  
Show in 2012. and 2013. had the best lineup. And then came Josephine Skriver, Sara Sampaio, Stella Maxwell, Romee Strijd, Taylor Hill etc. And I really like them, don't get me wrong, but they became angels after 3 or 4 years and that's absurd.. I know they have to put new generation of models, but they fucked it up by doing it too soon. Capital mistake was shipping Adriana and Alessandra for too long, (Again, don't get me wrong, I adore them, they're my queens) by not letting other models to stand out too. They had Behati, Candice, Lily, Izabel, Karlie, Lindsay, Erin, Miranda.. And they didn't ship them hard enough so when Adriana and Alessandra leave, the have the next queens. Only Candice, Behati and Lily are currently saving VS. 
I love Jo, Taylor, Romee and others but I miss the old days.
I miss old days when VS was more concentrated on being the best, not being the biggest. With so many models, too much is happening on the runway at the same time, and every model should have their hot minute on that stage to show off their catwalk.","VS"
"Very disappointing shows of late.too much focus on music not on the ladies. Stupid camera angles and editing. The old days the show was much better.","VS"
"I have been to Shanghai, it's an amazing city and I love it!","VS"
"Love Harry so much.","VS"

"Wow, that Balmain/Victoria Secret collabration is so hideous and ugly! :o The models if it wasn't for their beauty and their walks, that would have been a complete wreck. I was assuming based on the clothes I have seen Balmain create, it would be something incredible but it was trash. When I saw Candice's outfit, all I was thinking about how I can get that bra in Walmart for $5, it looked so cheap and terrible! That was not justice for the models!","VS"

"THE WORST SHOW EVER
I love VS fashion show, I'm a huuge fan of all the models, following them on social media and everything. I was so hyped and excited about the show..but, I have watched it and I'm just disappointed..
And what's wrong? First of all, the line up..
Take a circus section in 2012. for example, Adriana opening the show was legendary, and then Miranda Kerr, Doutzen Kroes, Candice, Erin Heatherton, Izabel Goulart, Karlie Kloss.. Every girl on that runway was a PRO, show stopper, absolutely gorgeous.
All VS models were pros, veterans and huge names in fashion industry.  Small time models were only walking in pink section for at least 4 years before the main one. Behati Prinsloo has been in pink for 5 years, all together 11 years in Victoria's secret and still haven't gotten the fantasy bra. Behati opened one section after 6 years on runway. And what happened last year? Jasmine Tookes was wearing fantasy bra, and she's been in VS for only 5 years at a time!!  Fantasy bra was set to be worn by the greatest models of Victoria's secret, not practically a newby. 
This year was 55 models in the show, In my opinion VS was just fine with 30,40 models when all of them were fantastic professionals.  Ming Xi falling was just pathetic, and Sanne Vloet almost fell  when she posed at the end of the runway which is hilarious. Many girls were just blowing kisses, or striking some awkward newby poses, and you can clearly see that they are scared and shaking, like VS is out of their league. VS models should be fierce,confident,powerful, and breathtaking, and those are only a few left.  
Show in 2012. and 2013. had the best lineup. And then came Josephine Skriver, Sara Sampaio, Stella Maxwell, Romee Strijd, Taylor Hill etc. And I really like them, don't get me wrong, but they became angels after 3 or 4 years and that's absurd.. I know they have to put new generation of models, but they fucked it up by doing it too soon. Capital mistake was shipping Adriana and Alessandra for too long, (Again, don't get me wrong, I adore them, they're my queens) by not letting other models to stand out too. They had Behati, Candice, Lily, Izabel, Karlie, Lindsay, Erin, Miranda.. And they didn't ship them hard enough so when Adriana and Alessandra leave, the have the next queens. Only Candice, Behati and Lily are currently saving VS. 
I love Jo, Taylor, Romee and others but I miss the old days.
I miss old days when VS was more concentrated on being the best, not being the biggest. With so many models, too much is happening on the runway at the same time, and every model should have their hot minute on that stage to show off their catwalk.","VS"
"Very disappointing shows of late.too much focus on music not on the ladies. Stupid camera angles and editing. The old days the show was much better.","VS"

"VSFS producers need to start listening to their viewers. Gone are the days where the VS Angels were iconic women with household names. The Angels of today lack individuality and recognition. You can't tell one from the rest, and the girls seem to be getting thinner every year. I'm not skinny shaming, but VS used to be known for having healthy/fit, curvy looking women walking down the runway. Even the costumes do not stun the way they used to (2017 being particularly boring). VSFS is in need of a serious overhaul.","VS"
"Bro.....lmfaooooooooooooo!!!!!!

"Candice's few second saved this commercial, and she in general saved VS from going into obscurity. Candice is VS nowadays. Other models helped VS to be known, but Candice helped this brand to continue to be successful.
I think she has more photos, catalog covers, commercials etc then all the angels combined, and the reason is she sells the most, because people like her the most.
I must say VS did her dirty in this commercial, just few seconds of screentime, but they will gladly use her for her fans, when she is the only angel who has trending wordlwide last year even when she wasn't in show and pregnant.
VS gets much more from Candice, than she from them, and I think it is time for her to leave them. I am not going to lie, for about a decade they treated her better then any angel, including Adriana, they gave her any honor possible, but lately they are doing her dirty and not giving her respect she deserves.","VS"

"Romee 😍","VS"
"They are beautiful but Victoria's Secret should be concerned that being sexy is not about what we have is what we do with our bodies. We can feel sexiness not through having long legs, nice skin, blue eyes or lips but through our confidence in wearing lingerie from your brand... Will be a big issue if you continue focusing in one body shape such as called your angels because I can be an angel also just by showing how am happy with myself in your lingeries as well the plus size woman as other woman with skin condition are angels in my eyes because they always showed the most confidence that having a little cellulite or skin condition, or having an accident they are sexy because of who they are and of course they can show it from you ads. Marketing campaigns can be harmful and pass the wrong message and, affect a women's life negatively. In the future, you will need to add more body shapes, stories, even others because we see ourselves in your lingerie if confidence in ourselves is always been the way to show that we are sexy.","VS"

"Candice's few second saved this commercial, and she in general saved VS from going into obscurity. Candice is VS nowadays. Other models helped VS to be known, but Candice helped this brand to continue to be successful.
I think she has more photos, catalog covers, commercials etc then all the angels combined, and the reason is she sells the most, because people like her the most.
I must say VS did her dirty in this commercial, just few seconds of screentime, but they will gladly use her for her fans, when she is the only angel who has trending wordlwide last year even when she wasn't in show and pregnant.
VS gets much more from Candice, than she from them, and I think it is time for her to leave them. I am not going to lie, for about a decade they treated her better then any angel, including Adriana, they gave her any honor possible, but lately they are doing her dirty and not giving her respect she deserves.","VS"

"They are beautiful but Victoria's Secret should be concerned that being sexy is not about what we have is what we do with our bodies. We can feel sexiness not through having long legs, nice skin, blue eyes or lips but through our confidence in wearing lingerie from your brand... Will be a big issue if you continue focusing in one body shape such as called your angels because I can be an angel also just by showing how am happy with myself in your lingeries as well the plus size woman as other woman with skin condition are angels in my eyes because they always showed the most confidence that having a little cellulite or skin condition, or having an accident they are sexy because of who they are and of course they can show it from you ads. Marketing campaigns can be harmful and pass the wrong message and, affect a women's life negatively. In the future, you will need to add more body shapes, stories, even others because we see ourselves in your lingerie if confidence in ourselves is always been the way to show that we are sexy.","VS"

"They are beautiful but Victoria's Secret should be concerned that being sexy is not about what we have is what we do with our bodies. We can feel sexiness not through having long legs, nice skin, blue eyes or lips but through our confidence in wearing lingerie from your brand... Will be a big issue if you continue focusing in one body shape such as called your angels because I can be an angel also just by showing how am happy with myself in your lingeries as well the plus size woman as other woman with skin condition are angels in my eyes because they always showed the most confidence that having a little cellulite or skin condition, or having an accident they are sexy because of who they are and of course they can show it from you ads. Marketing campaigns can be harmful and pass the wrong message and, affect a women's life negatively. In the future, you will need to add more body shapes, stories, even others because we see ourselves in your lingerie if confidence in ourselves is always been the way to show that we are sexy.","VS"

"So no more real 'getting in the holiday spirit' videos?  Previous 'holiday' videos were extremely cute, festive, and made people laugh.  Not even necessarily sexy, but cute.  My wife even liked them because they were funny.

If you're going to create a 'Social Justice Warrior' video, make it as an extra video and label it 'respect' or something.  Not 'holiday'.  That video really gets me in the 'Holiday' spirit [sarc] (watch all previous annual Holiday videos (not the videos labeled 'commercials')).  This really makes me want to go out and buy my wife a plain-looking sweater, which I wouldn't go to Victoria's Secret to buy.

UNLESS...I am wrong and I am not finding their annual typical 'holiday' video (again, not the videos labeled 'commercial').  If it does exist and I am just missing it, you can disregard my post.  It applies if this is a 'replacement' to the videos that they have been doing since 2011.  I am not saying this video isn't a good 'message'.","VS"

"GOD SAYS: ""but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a. woman to lust after her has committed. adultery with her already in his heart."" Please get right with God today, we are living in the end of the end times. If you read the Bible you will know. God is real whether you believe it or not, we have all sinned and fall short of the Glory of God. Please take Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and repent right now. There will bea day of judgment and unless you have taken Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour you will forever be thrown into the lake of fire (burning lava pretty much). There is 0 room for sin in Gods Kingdom, so please get right with God.
End Times (the events that will happen before God returns) Bible verses: 2 Timothy 3:2 ""People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,""     Revelation 16:4 (rivers have been turning blood red all over the world) ""The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.""  Matthew 24:8 (People hate Christians/Gods word, we are the most persecuted people and most hated in the world,) Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8All these are the beginning of birth pains. 9Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations on account of My name.…   Isaih 17:1 ""A prophecy against Damascus: ""See, Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins.""   Forget about world peace, that is a false idea from the devil. How can we imperfect people ever accomplish perfect peace? Only Jesus was perfect, if you have taken him as your Lord and Saviour you will have perfect peace.","VS"

Unfortunaltly i am tall but not skinny. And im only 13 years of age and i have starved myself before, didnt drink eat a lot, and worked my body to hard and the ending result was me just crying in bed all night about how i hate my life and how disgusting I am , fat, ugly, stupid of me to think that one day i will be a VS model. Still to this day i cry and am very sad, im still currently 13 and i dont know how to accept my body , but my advice is to be happy with you and be proud. You can only change things to a certain standard, such as your body. xx","VS"

"I think there's something seriously wrong with the modelling/fashion industry, / Vogue's priorities if they assess the most popular thing in Modelling/Media right now as being Brooklyn Beckham and Kendall Jenner. Basically rich people's kids? Thats what you choose to expose and shed light on through your massive platform. Whats trending and hip? To be honest I feel more like that kind of stuff is shoved onto us and percieved to be popular than actually being popular.","VogueUK"

"What adobe program was she using to do the layout of the magazine? InDesign?","VogueUK"
"I love her","VogueUK"
"If vogue is going to be showcasing the interiors of their offices they may should consider a redesign of them at least in the 73 questions episode with Lupita and others produced by Vogue they will show you inside their door and economy just doesn't sell. The magazines are so carefully thought out and the insides and interworking they are produced out of are a bit well, underwhelming to say the least. Take a note from the devil wears prada and continue to sell the dream like a dior or a chanel profits off of their itty bittys like their perfume and lipstick.","VogueUK"
"I have always wanted to become a Creative Director","VogueUK"
"This is so wonderful! I love Vogue's direction in still being such an iconic part of fashion but being relatable in a way that makes you appreciate it even more for the hard work that everyone puts in.","VogueUK"
"this is very interesting!!!","VogueUK"

There must be thousands of young women and men of all ethnicities applying to Vogue. Is it coincidence that after filtering everyone out their whole staff is completely white?","VogueUK"

"Attention!! Attention!!
Did you know As a second layer of clothing, underwear can serve as a barrier between your groin and the potentially irritating material, ensuring your package remains safe?? 
Yeah that’s why JONTIS underwear is giving some extra benefits to you. Lets check it out!!
? As long as you keep yours clean, wearing JONTIS underwear reduces your risk of getting crotch rot.     It absorb sweat well, unlike pants, jeans, and shorts in general, keeping your boys dry.
? To avoid unwittingly staining your front, JONTIS is the best solution.
? JONTIS underwear now offers innovations and new technology to let you choose whichever style makes you feel the most confident.
? Cotton underwear from JONTIS, in particular, also comes with a host of health benefits. Cotton works to absorb moisture which can encourage bacterial growth and therefore lead to UTIs, bacterial vaginosis, or yeast infections. 
? Going commando leaves you with nothing but your own devices for seduction if you get lucky. No matter how hot you are, you could offend your partner if you come to the party with no drawers. Some people think it’s creepy.
There are also underwear designed to enhance your goods. An example is  http://stores.ebay.co.uk/jontis-underwear-world.

Did you know As a second layer of clothing, underwear can serve as a barrier between your groin and the potentially irritating material, ensuring your package remains safe?? 
Yeah that’s why JONTIS underwear is giving some extra benefits to you. Lets check it out!!
? As long as you keep yours clean, wearing JONTIS underwear reduces your risk of getting crotch rot.     It absorb sweat well, unlike pants, jeans, and shorts in general, keeping your boys dry.
? To avoid unwittingly staining your front, JONTIS is the best solution.
? JONTIS underwear now offers innovations and new technology to let you choose whichever style makes you feel the most confident.

"Thank you so much for this informative series!","VogueUK"
"Alexa looks like she is Hary Style older sister!!!","VogueUK"
"One more thing, if you could put subtitles in other languages it would help a lot of other people who don't speak English have access to such great content. I'm from Brazil and I know that without speaking English you are put aside from a lot of great content about fashion that is only available in English. Please take this into consideration. I'm just in love with these series! ;))","VogueUK"
"I've always seen pictures of Alexa's style on magazines, websites and social media but I didn't know much about her. Since I've starting to watch these series I looked up online to know more about her because I just Loved her spontaneity, her humour and her charisma. She made these series be so natural and organic! I loved it! I'm just watching all episodes  from season 1 and so excited for what is yet to come in the seconde! Congrats British Vogue it's amazing!","VogueUK"
"Joseph is so hottt","VogueUK"

"can anyone ID alexas sweater at 8:40?","VogueUK"

"Loveee Alexa!! ♥ Her style is so cool x","VogueUK"
"To sound American you simply make every sentence sound like its a question lol","VogueUK"
"Alexa I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO LAND A JOB IN FASHION DOING WHAT YOU DO AS FAR AS INTERVIEWING AND HOSTING AND GETTING INVOLVED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA.  Is this type of job only available in regards to magazines or are more fashion brands considering this !","VogueUK"

"❤︎ ❤︎ ❤︎ ❤︎  New silk V Power dress on the way xo!","VogueUK"
"I would love to know more about jobs in PR and visual merchandising. This series is amazing and incredably inspiring. And Alexa is a total babe","VogueUK"
"This series is truly amazing! I was already quite happy with the first season because it opens up a world that is still quite closed and secretive. However, I found it too focused on 'the usual jobs' that we know in fashion such as creative directors, stylists and editors. I want to work in fashion since I was 12 years old and but I know that design is not for me. This first episode gave me so much hope to the possibilities and variety of jobs that I can aspire to. Plus, Alexa is a great host: charming, funny and she takes count of what the audience wants to learn about. Can't wait for the next episode! :)","VogueUK"
"Love!! So helpful and interesting !!!! Please keep doing these series!!","VogueUK"
"i'm only here for Alexa.","VogueUK"

"Thanks for making this second part of the series. Very inspiring and eye-opening!!","VogueUK"
"amazing! i'm studying economics as well and it's nice to hear people talk about their experience, because it can be hard sometimes if you don't know exactly what your job is going to be about. This gave a very good overview on the possibilities there are in the fashion industry or like in a process of creating in general. Seeing this inspires me and other people to study hard so you have all the opportunities in the end. sorry for my bad english, greetings from Germany!","VogueUK"
"also I wanna work for Opening Ceremony based on the type of questions they ask in the interviews. haha","VogueUK"
"I particularly loved this episode. as someone who is passionate about Fashion but instead has a Masters in science, this was very much enlightening and encouraging. thank you British Vogue!","VogueUK"
"i love opening ceremony!!!!!
wish there will be more videos about it","VogueUK"
"I love how 'back in the day' you could work for a retail company and you could move up and get recruited into corporate which leads to other job opportunities. Now, all I hear people say is ""it's about who you know"". SOME companies don't seem to value their long time employees like that anymore. 

Just speaking from experience.","VogueUK"
"having just been accepted to study fashion communication and businesses at uni this series is amazing showing me the areas i enjoy and showing me what areas i can work within without having to make a dress. i really love these series. i would like to know what businesses think of interests and whats the best way to go about it x","VogueUK"

"I love these videos so much, but I'd like to make a suggestion :)  Whenever Alexa is interviewing people about jobs, they always sound so fascinating, but they never explain what their job entails.  It always leaves me wondering...but what exactly is a PR person (public relations, but what precisely does that entail), or ""what was their art project and how did it transition into their brand?""  It's as if Alexa already knows their backstories and we don't so it would be awesome to have the jobs explained more :)))","VogueUK"

"I vogue, I'm a fashion student in Australia. I love these series and find them highly resourceful, however there's something missing. Can you please do an episode on the environmental impact the fashion industry is having in the 21st Century, because it is the most important issue in the fashion industry at the moment (and missing from both series so far). I know its not a feel good issue and against the grain of what vogue usually ""does,"" however it needs to be explored and I want to know what vogue is doing to promote sustainability, or not doing...","VogueUK"

"Great video but incorrect about agencies taking 40%.  They take a 20% commission from the model's fee and then charge the client 20% booking fee so off the total amount the client pays they take off 1/3 or 33.3333% and the model keeps 2/3rds (66.7%) which i guess isn't much more than Alexa's miscalculation of 60%.  They still fucking rinse you though, and not just with the commission, apartments (always overcrowded and overpriced), prints, comp cards, website fees, they do a markup on all of these, they don't charge you for that shit at cost price, they make almost as much money from the models as they do from the clients.  Not to mention there's now so many youngsters trying to get into it that reputable agencies even charge models for portfolio development test shoots.  These always used to be on a tfp/trade basis, i.e. photographer, stylist, makeup artist, model etc all get pictures for their portfolio and no money changes hands, but now there is so much supply of models that they are charging young hopefuls for the opportunity to 'make it'.  Pfffff don't make me laugh.  Maybe it's like the equivalent of getting some sort of qualification but personally, I think if a model has true potential they won't need to pay any startup costs except for the money to get to meetings and castings.  But fashion law is BADLY needed here in the UK and actually, all over.  It's great that they are protecting models in New York but they forget that most models actually travel so the law cannot protect models if they get rinsed by a dodgy agency in Thailand and end up getting forced into doing high class escort work (yes, this shit happens all the time in the model industry) and threatened to have their passports seized if they don't work to make the money that they owe the agency for the flights and the overpriced apartment (in which they share a bedroom with 5 other girls, who are also getting into debt slavery).  The Model's Alliance in New York can't do shit about this, they can only warn people by blacklisting the agencies' names and telling all the agencies in the US and in their international network not to work with these agencies.  The trouble is, though, so many of them are doing it on the downlow that they figure, 'well, if the girls (or boys) are at least booking good jobs, we don't mind if a little dodgy stuff is happening on the side, the girls know how to handle themselves, i mean, it's not like we don't do a bit of that here anyway'.  Cos the line between industry networking parties (which models get invited to all the time and are encouraged and sometimes even coerced by their agencies into attending), and high class escorting starts to look a bit thin when you realise the agencies are getting a little commission from the nightclub to ensure that a certain number of attractive young ladies come down to the club to 'entertain' their rich guests who work in the world of finance and tech etc (i.e. disgusting men with more money than grace).","VogueUK"

"First of all I would like to say thank you for not just entertaining episodes but EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL. For many people these documentaries are the only way to stay in touch with innovations on insights of fashion industry and get a little touch of education in this field even if you have 0 opportunities.  Apart from the absence of easy access to the info on these topics there is a language gap. A lot of important information about the industry today is available ONLY IN ENGLISH. Important movies like ""The next black - A film about future of clothing"", ""Bill Cunningham New York"", ""Tom Ford"" are not translated, statistics etc. And these episodes would be great material for Global Understanding of what actually fashion is and how it works inside. Language is an issue when it comes to Globalization of fashion. Many talented people outside the UK and US want to relate themselves to this world. Many come to UK and US to get an education in order to be closer. I am one of them. But would a VISA type-1 (student VISA) or absence of citizenship be a barrier for potential employers? How welcoming is the industry for International people with business, physiology or other majors?  I hope ALEXA can touch some of these problems in the future episodes.","VogueUK"

"I love how she isn't embarrassed to say when she doesn't understand a term/word ..so brave lol","VogueUK"
"Great video but incorrect about agencies taking 40%.  They take a 20% commission from the model's fee and then charge the client 20% booking fee so off the total amount the client pays they take off 1/3 or 33.3333% and the model keeps 2/3rds (66.7%) which i guess isn't much more than Alexa's miscalculation of 60%.  They still fucking rinse you though, and not just with the commission, apartments (always overcrowded and overpriced), prints, comp cards, website fees, they do a markup on all of these, they don't charge you for that shit at cost price, they make almost as much money from the models as they do from the clients.  Not to mention there's now so many youngsters trying to get into it that reputable agencies even charge models for portfolio development test shoots.  These always used to be on a tfp/trade basis, i.e. photographer, stylist, makeup artist, model etc all get pictures for their portfolio and no money changes hands, but now there is so much supply of models that they are charging young hopefuls for the opportunity to 'make it'.  Pfffff don't make me laugh.  Maybe it's like the equivalent of getting some sort of qualification but personally, I think if a model has true potential they won't need to pay any startup costs except for the money to get to meetings and castings.  But fashion law is BADLY needed here in the UK and actually, all over.  It's great that they are protecting models in New York but they forget that most models actually travel so the law cannot protect models if they get rinsed by a dodgy agency in Thailand and end up getting forced into doing high class escort work (yes, this shit happens all the time in the model industry) and threatened to have their passports seized if they don't work to make the money that they owe the agency for the flights and the overpriced apartment (in which they share a bedroom with 5 other girls, who are also getting into debt slavery).

"Dear Alexa Chung and/or Vogue,
I'm a high school students who is interested in the fashion industry and have begun designing dresses for myself and my peers. But I don't know how to go from the sketching and ideas part to the starting a business and making a living off of it part. Every time I want to try and pursue it. I'm reminded that I need to go to college for something I can survive with, not just a dream job that can't pay the bills or barely pays them. Can you make another series that goes in depth on how to go from the first sketches to the real thing and how the designers went through that phase of ""I like this"" to ""I love doing this and I'm going to keep doing it"" and how they took off from there. Sorry if this is pretty long 😅 I'm just very interested in the fashion industry and I would love to get some more inside info on how it works from the actual source itself and from people like you.
Sincerely,
A fan that has one year left before they have to choose and go to college 😖😖😖😓😓😵","VogueUK"

I'm a high school students who is interested in the fashion industry and have begun designing dresses for myself and my peers.

I'm reminded that I need to go to college for something I can survive with, not just a dream job that can't pay the bills or barely pays them. Can you make another series that goes in depth on how to go from the first sketches to the real thing and how the designers went through that phase of ""I like this"" to ""I love doing this and I'm going to keep doing it"" and how they took off from there. Sorry if this is pretty long 😅 I'm just very interested in the fashion industry and I would love to get some more inside info on how it works from the actual source itself and from people like you.

"For a Season 3, I would love for you to explore more of the business side. (Ethically?) sourcing materials from manufacturers. How to mass produce your unique designs. How to effectively run an online business - e.g. Keeping up with global distribution demands. Profit margins (re: make cheap, sell expensive) --> I believe makeup is an industry with one of the biggest profit margins. The whole thing of celebrities being given clothing to wear and promote at red carpet events (PR thing). Successful cross promotion of fashion brands and other industries. The  marketing chain: Designers make clothes --> pitch to magazines like vogue --> retail stores take best items from mags and feature in stores. (Not sure if that's how it actually works haha). There's something interesting and exciting there. The real nuts and bolts of how to turn ""someone making clothes"" into a ""fashion brand"".","VogueUK"

"For a Season 3, I would love for you to explore more of the business side. (Ethically?) sourcing materials from manufacturers. How to mass produce your unique designs. How to effectively run an online business - e.g. Keeping up with global distribution demands. Profit margins (re: make cheap, sell expensive) --> I believe makeup is an industry with one of the biggest profit margins. The whole thing of celebrities being given clothing to wear and promote at red carpet events (PR thing). Successful cross promotion of fashion brands and other industries. The  marketing chain: Designers make clothes --> pitch to magazines like vogue --> retail stores take best items from mags and feature in stores. (Not sure if that's how it actually works haha). There's something interesting and exciting there. The real nuts and bolts of how to turn ""someone making clothes"" into a ""fashion brand"".","VogueUK"

"Nice video. Don't like the thick brow look on some people. Personally like to work with that people have, and emphasize the beauty of what they have. So for who are blessed with lush thick eyebrows, rock them. Those whose eyebrows are sparse, go for a softer look. Don't like the instabrows personally for everyday looks, the ones that are very penciled. I prefer more natural brow shapes. But well, it all boils down to personal taste. Mine is just an opinion in many that are equally valid.","VogueUK"

"Thin or thick, it's about preference and style!","VogueUK"
"I would like to look like Wednesday Adam's cousin","VogueUK"
"Nice video. Don't like the thick brow look on some people. Personally like to work with that people have, and emphasize the beauty of what they have. So for who are blessed with lush thick eyebrows, rock them. Those whose eyebrows are sparse, go for a softer look. Don't like the instabrows personally for everyday looks, the ones that are very penciled. I prefer more natural brow shapes. But well, it all boils down to personal taste. Mine is just an opinion in many that are equally valid.","VogueUK"
"thank god natural brows are the in thing right now. and I hope they never go away.
I hated plucking my eyebrows just to draw them back on again  😑😑😑","VogueUK"

"I literally love her and her style, if anyone know where she got those jeans hit me up","VogueUK"
"I think she's amazing. To be on a personal quest to better yourself is one thing, but to do it publicly is very cool. It takes a lot to be that transparent on such a public platform. I think the fact that she's so honest with what she struggles with is good. I hope she finds peace with herself. She seems like a really sweet person.","VogueUK"

It was not particularly healthy but I felt amazing, and happy she would cook all the time. Now i'm eating kale, green juices, gluten free and I have anxiety, panic attacks ect.. I'm not happy. But I'm not sure I want to go back eating animals, and gluten for exemple because I feel so heavy and I have strong nausea after eating that way. I don't know what went wrong..","VogueUK"

"For someone in the beauty/ fashion industry, Camille was incredibly honest about her struggles with eating and over-eating..... appreciate it.","VogueUK"
"Camille you are the best!!!","VogueUK"
"Where is Camille's tee shirt from?!","VogueUK"
"This is the best series Vogue has put out. I am usually let-down because most of the videos have no depth & end up being product pitches or the obviously scripted Q&A; so staged. This is real & really important. Camille really puts herself out there & is not afraid to be vulnerable. Camille you are fabulous & down-to-earth. I hope you find the key to release smoking from your life. It is extremely addictive--don't be hard on yourself. Just take it one moment at a time. Best to you♥","VogueUK"
"anyone know where Camille's bag is from (when she's in the supermarket)  ?  Gucci?","VogueUK"
"greens yey, food first! difficult when you have an industry pressure like Camille does, but even people outside the show business comparing themselves to the younger selves, we just need to let it go and eat healthy, be plant based","VogueUK"
"I look at Camille and think she is so cool and perfect and hasn't a care in the world, but she struggles with all things us mortal women struggle with.  I feel for ya Camille, it is hard to give up those cigs.  Former overeater, under eater, smoker, stress addict, too - all such struggles to overcome.  This is a great series, so far.","VogueUK"

"Just reminds me I need treatment again. I've eaten 2 meals in 3 weeks and snacked here and there. I'm so hungry.","VogueUK"
"I can relate to the whole health conversation. I didn't choose to be gluten free, it is medical, but the frustrating part of most people thinking it's a trend when it's not to for me. I use to be able to not think too much about food before 2010, but for 6 years+  I have to be overly cautious not just for food, but in products and so much more everyday stuff.","VogueUK"
"This is so lovely! It's better than comfort food. Thank you, Camille!!","VogueUK"
"I LOVE this series can't wait to see more","VogueUK"

"am i the only dude watching this?","VogueUK"
"This is so great. I love how Camille is able to be vulnerable in showing us her insecurities when typically one would assume someone as beautiful as her is confident in their everyday life. She's so humble and transparent in showing that she too is an ordinary human with struggles like the rest of us. You go girl. <3 Thanks for being an inspiration to everyone's journeys.","VogueUK"

"Where are the bird earrings from?","VogueUK"
"When I went vegan I recovered from various eating disorders I've suffered from for over 7 years. It was a shift from thinking of food as good as bad, instead food was this thing I eat to make the world a more positive place. I felt like food could be a tool to stop animal suffering, global warming and makes my body healthy. I love food and I enjoy it and don't deny myself anything.","VogueUK"
"seems like junk science to take advantage of depressed girls. it's a basic diet people eat in emerging economies, but jacked up more to profit from western ladies ( w/ modelling incomes). kenyan girls just grab a mango from a tree, make some sima and call it a day.","VogueUK"
"I love how this gives me positive advice about eating healthy","VogueUK"
"I super love this series!!","VogueUK"
"I love how they acknowledge the positive mentality that needs to accompany this journey.  Looking forward to the rest of this series!","VogueUK"

"Camille, thank you for being so honest with us about what you're grappling with facing wellness. I can absolutely relate 100% to the conversations that you had with the experts in this episode.

"Where is Camille's tee shirt from?!","VogueUK"
"This is the best series Vogue has put out. I am usually let-down because most of the videos have no depth & end up being product pitches or the obviously scripted Q&A; so staged. This is real & really important. Camille really puts herself out there & is not afraid to be vulnerable. Camille you are fabulous & down-to-earth. I hope you find the key to release smoking from your life. It is extremely addictive--don't be hard on yourself. Just take it one moment at a time. Best to you♥","VogueUK"
"anyone know where Camille's bag is from (when she's in the supermarket)  ?  Gucci?","VogueUK"
"greens yey, food first! difficult when you have an industry pressure like Camille does, but even people outside the show business comparing themselves to the younger selves, we just need to let it go and eat healthy, be plant based","VogueUK"
"I look at Camille and think she is so cool and perfect and hasn't a care in the world, but she struggles with all things us mortal women struggle with.  I feel for ya Camille, it is hard to give up those cigs.  Former overeater, under eater, smoker, stress addict, too - all such struggles to overcome.  This is a great series, so far.","VogueUK"

"I can relate to the whole health conversation. I didn't choose to be gluten free, it is medical, but the frustrating part of most people thinking it's a trend when it's not to for me. I use to be able to not think too much about food before 2010, but for 6 years+  I have to be overly cautious not just for food, but in products and so much more everyday stuff.","VogueUK"
"This is so lovely! It's better than comfort food. Thank you, Camille!!","VogueUK"

It was a shift from thinking of food as good as bad, instead food was this thing I eat to make the world a more positive place. I felt like food could be a tool to stop animal suffering, global warming and makes my body healthy. I love food and I enjoy it and don't deny myself anything.","VogueUK"
"seems like junk science to take advantage of depressed girls. it's a basic diet people eat in emerging economies, but jacked up more to profit from western ladies ( w/ modelling incomes). kenyan girls just grab a mango from a tree, make some sima and call it a day.","VogueUK"

"I feel the same, when I was younger I grew up in France, my mum would go to the market and buy meat and fish and vegetables and we would eat pasta and go to the bakery and buy lots of bread to eat with different kinds of cheeses, in the weekend we would buy patisseries and she would make homemade strawberry yogurts with fresh strawberries mixed with crème fraiche and yogurt and white suger and it tasted like paradise. It was not particularly healthy but I felt amazing, and happy she would cook all the time. Now i'm eating kale, green juices, gluten free and I have anxiety, panic attacks ect.. I'm not happy. But I'm not sure I want to go back eating animals, and gluten for exemple because I feel so heavy and I have strong nausea after eating that way. I don't know what went wrong..","VogueUK"

"This series is so cool I loved it","VogueUK"
"Camille's reactions, comments and facial expressions feel so real and honest and fresh compared to all expression-less instagram instant celebrities that are so much featured on the internet. Some of these instagram people (sisters with fake lips or asses from the K family.. cough cough), even though they might look beautiful or slim or pore-less, they look the same on youtube because even though we are seeing them move, in a moving picture, we don't feel anything looking at it. But Camille feels so natural, alive and sweet! She is someone that you want to have a coffee with, breakfast with, go out! Experiencing wellness through her eyes was so great. I wish Vogue or someone else on YouTube feature her more!!!!","VogueUK"

"The usage of wellness in Vogue and in this video leads me to ask, What matters most? Should we promote wellness as a label or an idea? We all value a number of treasured words in the English language that have special meanings for us, words that nearly everyone generally understands as we do. Examples are words like love, freedom, democracy and kindness. We should desire nothing less for the word wellness. The word represents an idea that embraces positive states of being, distinct from the norm, that is, the medically-focused mediocrity of preventing disease, weight gain, premature aging and the countless slings and arrows that accompany failure to pay attention to daily care of the body and the mind. (Of course we care about minimizing risks, but the pursuit of genuine wellness carries the serendipitous side effects of attending to prevention of illness while it enables positive states beyond the non-sick ordinary.) 

The word wellness represents a mindset and lifestyle marked by a conscious commitment to nourishing wellbeing, a life as self-reliant as practical that embraces exuberant living, respects science and reason and offers a journey through life marked by joyful fine-tuning of optimal meanings and purposes for being alive.  

Healers and programs in spas, medical centers, workplaces and everywhere else can facilitate, explain, guide and support this idea of wellness, but only the individual can make this REAL wellness a reality, a part of her or his existence. 

All good wishes and be well, if you can. Most can't - it's too hard to understand properly and, most difficult, to sustain over time if you are fortunate to get started properly. But, try anyway. It might still be worthwhile.

 I personally  think, if u eat healthy you need to make the combo=  Drink more water NO even  sodas, Do Sports running, yoga stretching,  make a routine is nice to eat and cleanse your body, not once a month or year but every day :) hot water with lemon is so helpful, and sometimes once a week i put some ginger on it. I Never liked read meat since a kid, is not necesary to be vegan to be healthy, but if u do it, is great also.","VogueUK"

"But but why? to eat healthy, if u smooke ciggars or drink alcohol : /
 I personally  think, if u eat healthy you need to make the combo=  Drink more water NO even  sodas, Do Sports running, yoga stretching,  make a routine is nice to eat and cleanse your body, not once a month or year but every day :) hot water with lemon is so helpful, and sometimes once a week i put some ginger on it. I Never liked read meat since a kid, is not necesary to be vegan to be healthy, but if u do it, is great also.","VogueUK"

"3:21: vanitas","VogueUK"
"British Vogue rarely disappoints. Alas, here it does. Not in the content/topic, but it was hard to listen, let alone watch the presenter N Smart. Think horse meets cow & is shown Harris tweed. Nodding it’s way dumbly to the owner with teeth on display. Come on Vogue, I know it’s 2017, PC blah blah blah but really?? Her jeans have whiskers even a cat would frown at & she can’t even trot in those heels. Isn’t a wonder Stella suggested a makeover. Just because she works for Vogue doesn’t make her fashionable/hip/cool/watchable. Flashing a supermodel, st martins, v&A, london etc doesn’t cut it. Put some depth/thought into the content. Such a compelling subject has just become crass.

Doubt I’d watch the rest, of what would have been an excellent documentary. Thank Stella Tennant for her image/60 secs.","VogueUK"

"Where can I find a ""bag"" like that?","VogueUK"
"I love her","VogueUK"

"I started getting happier the less I wore makeup. Not 'happier' exactly, just less burdened with the thought of covering my flaws when it didn't even matter. I could consider myself beautiful and love my physical looks, or I could just not care about them, and I choose the latter. Less burden. Now I truly enjoy when I put on the little makeup that I do wear because I only do that sometimes when I want to enhance some kind of look my face has that day or go for a unique look at an outing. When you do it everyday you can wear the fun and the creativity out of it and it can start to take on a negative meaning. I'm all for letting girls wear what they want, but I think it would be wise for many to consider putting the foundation down for a second, it's inconsequential anyway. Anyhow, there are more important things about me than how I (or anyone) appear, as long as I am clean and washed of course. That's a matter of hygeine.","VogueUK"

She could be a spokesperson for large women who want to lose weight and then control their weight, because that is what she did. She lost 2 dress sizes to look like that. And the Bond thing? I haven't seen a Bond film since Roger  Moore, but I'd be first in line to watch her and Elba. You could totally believe she could beat up some villains before shagging Idriss  senseless.","VogueUK"

"LOL ! all these 12 year old instagram makeup fans commenting about Bella's face ! Well,hun.. this is not instagram,where drag makeup is still a trend ! It's a British Vogue for crying out loud and Bella looks absolutely gorgeous , simple and natural ! Too bad not everyone can see that,because unique beauty like Bella can only be appreciated by those who actually have some taste !","VogueUK"
"Bella is suffering from Lyme disease","VogueUK"
"These comments are making me sick! I don't know why you all feel the need to pick on her about her looks. You have no idea she could be the most insecure and self conscious person and you're all going to make it so much worse. I actually love her look and think she's beautiful. And a lot of models are supposed to be ""expressionless"" in photoshoots. :/","VogueUK"
"Is this an ad? If yes, be transparant about it. If no, then why is this even a video.","VogueUK"
"My queen","VogueUK"
"SE ME VOLO EL YOR","VogueUK"
"Belleza ❤❤❤❤❤❤","VogueUK"
"They should fire the makeup artists, they did bella so dirty. Her face contrasts the clothes and the setup too much.","VogueUK"
"her face is a little gaunt","VogueUK"
"""You don't agree with me that she is an attractive/likeable person, therefore you are nothing but jealous.""

"""She look sick"" Well she has lyme disease so....","VogueUK"
"there is something wrong about her face .. i don't know what but there is something  that i don't like on her .. maybe her boring zombi face or fake long nose .. she looks like an unhappy ill girl .. she is not beautiful for vs .. she is soo simple","VogueUK"
"lol.. This British Vogue right? I thought I clicked on american vogue.","VogueUK"
"boring!!","VogueUK"
"go Bella Hadid","VogueUK"
"My neighbour has more caracter than her","VogueUK"
"She's gorgeous, yall are jealous ugly cunts","VogueUK"
"she looks dead in the thumbnail? not hating it's not like she looks super skinny just huge bags under her eyes and a dead look???","VogueUK"
"Mesmerising eyes 💙","VogueUK"
"why does she look like an actual corpse?? like she's not deathly skinny or anything but her look is just so awfully vacant and unexpressive?","VogueUK"
"I'm sure Bella is an awesome person outside modelling and I do think she looks breathtaking but I can't appreciate someone who has spent thousands ot dollars on ones face to make it perfect for the runways. she looks like a completely different person now","VogueUK"
"❤️","VogueUK"
"Bonita vista.","VogueUK"

"And before you leave ,it's almost 6 pm","VogueUK"
"People are complaining but I'd rather watch these cute London girls any day over another Kardashian or Hadid","VogueUK"
"Yes it does seem to be a bit elitist to say the least. I'm sick of them putting clothes in that no one can afford and are not attainable to the average style concious woman. Why don't they do more dash than cash? I used to love reading Vogue and always used to look forward to it coming out each month. Now half of it is just full of adverts. And to pay £4.10 for a magazine is ridulous","VogueUK"
"Ah man the Waterhouse girls are just so lovely!","VogueUK"
"She is gorgeous but how unrealistic is this? Seriously!","VogueUK"
"i can't feel any charisma or whatsoever. Can i have more camille rowe? hahaha","VogueUK"

"boy she's ugly","VogueUK"
"Like, I'm in college and usually just wear leggings, a patagonia and birkenstocks. But whenever I watch a Leandra/ManRepeller vid, I'm urged to go home, put on high wasted mom jeans, 2-inch heels, and a fur vest","VogueUK"
"Where is her t shirt from?","VogueUK"
"Paris fashionistas be like with great style great skin but bad face always","VogueUK"
"Vogue please please please do a series with Leandra!!","VogueUK"
"Leandra is freakin gorgeous. Very unique and natural beauty.","VogueUK"
"y'all would have eye bags if you ran a multi million dollar business too","VogueUK"
"not much you can do to that face anyways. what a waste of product down the sink.","VogueUK"
"i respect Leandra, she's very authentic and I do find her very attractive","VogueUK"
"is she a model?","VogueUK"
"how old is this lady?! OMG","VogueUK"
"She's a true original.","VogueUK"
"She will age gracefully unlike some who will wake up and look totally different not only do I adore her, but I respect her!","VogueUK"
"where does she go?","VogueUK"
"Love her t-shirt! Anyone knows the brand?","VogueUK"
"So many mean comments. I think Leandra is attractive especially because she's unique, has character and style and she's not hiding her real self. An attractive person doesn't necessarily mean a standard type of beauty. I prefer Leandra a thousand times to some Playboy bleach blonde type of American beauty.","VogueUK"
"I genuinely think she's so beautiful!!","VogueUK"
"Leandra is brilliant! She has an amazing ability to transmit and communicate beauty <3","VogueUK"
"Her look is extraordinarily unique? I'm not one to really comment on the way people look, but I find her very alluring, even though i don't really find her pretty. ","VogueUK"
"I like her but she looks terrible in this video. Eye bags are really badly prominent, as in 50 year old's. Sorry to point out but minimal routine is for those who have nothing to hide.","VogueUK"
"why would she call herself man repeller","VogueUK"
"why would she call herself man repeller","VogueUK"
"holy eye bags","VogueUK"
"Is this a joke? I've never heard of this kid, but she's ugly...","VogueUK"
"I feel like we would be best friends in real life","VogueUK"
"leandra is such a goddess!!!!","VogueUK"
"I have seen a few of her videos and she seems pretentious. Has a Lena Dunham vibe ""I'm so cute but I'm not"". Seriously, you're not.","VogueUK"
"What?","VogueUK"
"affreuse mais sympa","VogueUK"
"some of you are really terrible , yeah she's has bags we can see them. maybe they are hereditary and she can't help it, so please get over yourselves !","VogueUK"
"wait I just have a question lol, is she not getting enough sleep or her eyes just naturally have bags under them lmao","VogueUK"
"love moreeeee","VogueUK"
"Honestly, I thought she was in her early 40's..... I just found out that she's 28...","VogueUK"
"Screeeamed when I saw you did a video with Leandra. She is THE female. I love her!! xxxx","VogueUK"
"Wow guys.. can't believe how nasty you are. What's she ever done to you?","VogueUK"

"Gorge","VogueUK"
"i like how simple her make up routine is <3","VogueUK"
"what highlighter? it didnt shine or anything?","VogueUK"

"why do I keep seeing her ugly face?","VogueUK"
"She looks so tired","VogueUK"
"Leandra is the best!!!! LOVE HER!","VogueUK"
"seems like she is mad at someone!! video threw so much shade, at those of whom create makeup tutorials...that's what I think!! #shade..#manrepeller","VogueUK"
"Did she not sleep at all?","VogueUK"
"I didn't know that she had greenish eyes","VogueUK"
"i dont think she needs any of that, cos the end result is the same as she first started lol","VogueUK"
"I find it refreshing that she goes without heavy eye makeup. It works for her an makes her feel comfortable and I respect that.","VogueUK"
"The ""lip stuff"" has a very nice color :)","VogueUK"
"To me it's the ultimate summer , make up when you have good skin but just need a little extra . She looks beautiful with and without maleup . The only thing - it's part of her charm now , are her bags under eyes .","VogueUK"
"To the people who say Leandra is ugly or has prematurely aged, if you are a fan of her website, you would know that she actually went through a devastating incident in her life last year. So I guess that's the reason why she doesn't look the same as she did before. Nonetheless, Leandra is still beautiful.","VogueUK"
"something doesn't look right with this lady. is she not well or something?","VogueUK"
"Puhaha this is the most realistically minimal makeup I've ever seen on YouTube. It's also how I do my makeup everyday lol","VogueUK"
"euh comment dire ? vous plaisantez,? est-ce une plaisanterie? c est juste pour rire!!i suppose?","VogueUK"
"Fml that's the easiest morning routine I've ever seen","VogueUK"
"that was fun :)","VogueUK"
"I think this is probably the most ugly girl I have ever seen. She should stars removing her mostacho.","VogueUK"
"We should have a Vogue series with her ^^","VogueUK"
"Love her!","VogueUK"

"She is good at walking , there is no doubt about it , and yes she is much better than Jenner or the Hadids, but you would be too if you mom was one of the most iconic models to date; would be embarrassing not to be good. However with just 4 or so shows and hardly any campaigns and prints giving her the title of 'supermodel' is not called for and semi insulting to the OG supermodels who didn't have famous parents and social media to aid them. Truth be told if Cindy wasn't her mother then she wouldn't have got the high end shows she did so quickly nor would she have received this much attention from Vogue. Her mum got her to this position,same as Gigi and Kendal but because Kaia's mum was/is an actual model she was able learn the ropes before coming in the industry which unfortunately wasn't the case for Kendal and the Hadids, they have the name and the fame but no one to aid their modelling skills.

"It would be useful to show a basic routine i.e. Cleanse, toner and moisturise using high street products that the ordinary woman can afford not all these fancy gadgets and expensive products :(","VogueUK"
"Who has time in the morning to do this when you have to be at work?","VogueUK"
"Her ear game is so strong","VogueUK"
"Love her!","VogueUK"
"Nothing she's saying makes a lick of scientific sense 🤓","VogueUK"
"There should seriously be a product list somewhere","VogueUK"
"Has British Vogue rehire her? In her last video she said that she was working for Birchbox now.","VogueUK"
"Yay, products I can't afford. Her skin is gorgeous though.","VogueUK"
"This was really beautiful","VogueUK"
"😍😍😍more winter videos please","VogueUK"
"Surely the skin doesn't accumulate enough dirt overnight to need a double cleanse most mornings? I would save that for the evening to remove the days dirt, SPF and make up. Unnecessary cleansing is especially bad during the Winter. Each to their own I suppose.","VogueUK"
"LOL","VogueUK"
"If you are in London you are so far north you do not need SPF in winter.    Also, can I convince you to use a washable cloth instead of those little disposable pads?","VogueUK"
"love it","VogueUK"
"I also agree with Mrminge cup.The 360 was a waste of time as you could see little detail.Why not show details of what happens to create vogue.Speak to designers,photographers.etc.but so we can actually see and hear them.    Do you use anything on your skin before cleanser ,also what did you use to clean the eye area.","VogueUK"
"Thank u I enjoyed that","VogueUK"
"I am a fan of double cleanings but only in the evening, double cleansing is too aggressive in the morning, even in the case of oily skin, you strip away your natural barrier and risk making it more sensitive and reactive. I wouldn't advice anyone to do it.","VogueUK"
"British Vogue I think needs to release another Camille Rowe or Alexa Ching type video where they went into detail with things that were incredibly informative. I feel like they lost a connection to the long videos that they were releasing. I just think they should release something like that, it doesn't have to star someone famous, just something new, thats unique.","VogueUK"
"Love the editing!","VogueUK"
"lovely but a list of products would be helpful as well.  xoxo","VogueUK"
"How do poor people like me take care of their skin🤔 is water and a cheap creme enough?","VogueUK"
"She's fantastic! Such a beautiful woman!","VogueUK"

"To compare these women and the force-fed, hunger striking Suffragettes of one hundred years ago that gained partial enfranchisement for women in Britain by way of the Representation of the People Act 1918, is a false equivalency. We are living in an inverted reality whereby claims of victimhood status opens the gates to ever higher levels of privilege, which have ironically been made possible by the very nature of Western Civilisation itself.","VogueUK"
"Love the new British Vogue!","VogueUK"

"I really don’t feel as though this encompasses feminism, there is too much of a focus on equality for women, when feminism, by very definition, is about about equality for both sexes.","VogueUK"
"I love British Vogue, but serioiusly? I thought bringing successful women on screen would involve them giving younger, unaccomplished women advice so they too can be successful in their career paths. A video to empower and encourage a younger generation of creative minds. But no, its just another cash into the times. A mole in the vortex of the social justice craze. British Vogue, you are better than this.","VogueUK"

"To the well-connected middle-aged hipster/Indies who no doubt mostly put this together New Order probably means a very different thing to them than say the millennials Vogue are extremely focused on courting. The title New Order in this present day holds even greater connotations of fascism. Ill-advised title.","VogueUK"

"Nice！！","VogueUK"

"What an astounding vlog~  Well done~And such a beautiful dancer~ This is why I'm only buying British Vogue instead of American Vogue from now on, so much more depth to the articles~ and vlogs~  The ""20 questions with whoever"" in American Vogue is the dumbest thing ever~","VogueUK"

"This video is so much inspiring","VogueUK"
"Beautiful","VogueUK"
"Thanks for this! I can only watch Frankie dancing via YouTube or on video, yet she has a quality that really focusses the watcher's attention on her steps, her body and what she is portraying. I can only imagine what she's like in real life!

Her partnership with Alex Campbell has been simply brilliant and I hope like mad I'll be able to see them dancing 'Giselle' together before too long. Frankie is only at the beginning of her career, but I have a feeling there are Great Things ahead for her. Now, I wonder whether British Vogue is available in Australia???","VogueUK"

Stay kind and graceful.

Take care of your inner and outer health; especially skin & face.
Keep color in your life especially if it looks good on you (those are the best colors)
In weak moments, get it together, then handle your business. 
Always walk tall, straight and keep your head up. As well to know your worth and never settle.","VogueUK"

Stay kind and graceful.
Appreciate the small things and be grateful for everything because “the best things in life are free.”
Dress your best to feel your best.
Take care of your inner and outer health; especially skin & face.
Keep color in your life especially if it looks good on you (those are the best colors)
In weak moments, get it together, then handle your business. 
Always walk tall, straight and keep your head up. As well to know your worth and never settle.","VogueUK"

"A 90s baby catapulted into this cloud of polished pop dust 
And then six million different personalities sang a bunch of
harmonies together. That's how I would describe myself.
I love working, I get a day off and I'm confused.
I'm like *laughs* cause I have to do something.
I'm this industry a lot of people can tell you a lot of different things 
And to be different things, or to sound a different way.
I think that you have to just listen to What's inside instead. 
I think I've learned that the more authentic and genuine it is, 
the better it will work for you. I'll never truly feel like ""okay, now I have 
made it, now I can stop."" It's gonna take such a long 
time for me to reach that satisfaction because I don't know what 
I would do without music. I'm very grateful to be here. And that kind of
overpowers any of the negative elements that come with fame i guess.","VogueUK"

"Wah wah wah...so many crybabies in the comments section. Big deal if it is product placement. Like everything needs to be relatable to your basic life. Sheesh. What a bunch of whingers.","VogueUK"

"An uninspiring and disingenuous conversation, wasted my time","VogueUK"
"Bangin ad I'd say.","VogueUK"
"Lovely, but.... bring back Camille Rowe! (please?)","VogueUK"
"This could have been so good except it was an advert dressed up as a conversation. I wish Vogue would get back to fashion.The dresses they were wearing were stunning,I'd rather have seen them in detail.Please Vogue,stop just going through the motion and get back to your high standard.","VogueUK"
"Have time for yourself! So often we forget to take care of ourselves because we are so consumed by everything and everyone else.","VogueUK"

"Beautifully styled room and women, love!","VogueUK"
"Just checked my Philips stock to make sure it's doing ok.","VogueUK"
"I thought it would be something similar to what camille did. But it s just an add for Philips.","VogueUK"
"LOVE Madeleine!!","VogueUK"
"Basically an advert for Phillips. What a waste honestly.","VogueUK"
"This doesn't seem genuine at all. Nice Vogue.","VogueUK"
"Visually, absolutely gorgeous","VogueUK"
"Hmmm  I agree with the comments about this looking like a Ad. The whole conversation they started with was just bland chit chat. As far as wellness it was very cookie cutter. Eat healthy, read a book and go to sleep early -_- Then start talking about a product with such detail. 3:24 Full product name and all. I'm sorry to sound negative but aside from the setting this just didn't seem genuine.","VogueUK"
"‘Wellbeing...sponsored by Phillips’.","VogueUK"
"ladies ladies ladies you dont know what regeneration and relaxation is until you get a massage from me.. I personally love cruising in my very custom car to melt the stress away","VogueUK"

"excellent marketing and product placement for the intended audience but guess I am not the target market. (no hate just my personal opinion) preferred the series by Alexa Chung and Camille Rowe","VogueUK"
"What a beautiful room and ambiance! And the dresses are gorgeous!","VogueUK"
"I preferred the Camilla Rowe documentary.","VogueUK"
"What rich, white women with families do to detox essentially. The first episode is not relatable to me, unlike Camille Rowe and Alexa Chung's series where I was hooked since day of release (of episode 1). Noting to self that I am not the target audience for this, a non white, non first world, single woman. But I hope I find some kind of relatability in the next episodes. I mean, I am in no means related to fashion professionally but I still found the Alexa series quite enjoyable :) (Note: Not spreading hate, just my opinion).","VogueUK"
"Yay British vogue update video.
i love the Setting beautiful place really

"Personally I think he had ruined the Brand. I have several pieces from the house and I know Louis Vuitton as a classic timeless brand. He has made the brand street wear and that is not what it’s known for. Kim jones was a better creative director than him. I do like some items from Virgil’s brand. However, I think he needs to stick to his own brand and Louis Vuitton needs to find a new one that will continue to make the brand iconic.","VogueUK"

He has made the brand street wear and that is not what it’s known for. Kim jones was a better creative director than him. I do like some items from Virgil’s brand.

"Pearls of wisdom always!","VogueUK"
"Never stop Oprah! Frigging awesome.","VogueUK"
"Edward thank you!!","VogueUK"
"Style is something very important. Oprah looks well and attractive.  Apparently she was in a very objective environment.  I just read of style, and discovered I had quite a lot of it, and it can be a cause for criticism.  The way Oprah says ""I am the first self made black Billionaire"" is nice. Despite my style if I had said, I have an extra ten dollars on a credit card, I would have been assaulted for arrogance.  Money we spend in the world. I hope we can keep it a world, a good one so that 10,000 hours objectively can earn another timely success in a talented ready man or woman. An equivalent from another day is possible. Who knows. But, I knew she would have been a teacher. I heard her at Krannert Center, and I saw a modest woman.  ...and I miss Maya Angelou!  You did what you knew to do, and when you knew better, you did better.  Hope for the world!  Vogue is awesome. Guess how I learned of style, from reading Diana Vreeland.  That's IT!!!  That's why they hate me, and complain, I've got STYLE!!!","VogueUK"
"Lovely dresses","VogueUK"
"Great questions! He is so genuine. She is so regal! That last answer was my favorite, she came undone😄! Love you Oprah","VogueUK"

"This is massive","VogueUK"
"I loved this interview. I would only ask that Oprah open her persepctive a little bit. At about the 4:15 mark she starts talking about how young people expect success to come so soon, but before us we have two people who hit major successes at age 19. Edward was the youngest fashion director at i-D magazine and Oprah was the youngest news anchor in Nashville. Look where they are now. When people fret over not having early-in-life success it's because of people like these high achievers here. They have set the example that others want to emulate. Where a person is early in their career has a direct effect on their earning potential in years to come. So it's reasonable to want that success as early as possible.","VogueUK"

"WOW THIS LITTLE BRATS ATTITUDE IS SOOO GROSS.....very disrespectful video.","Vogue"
"She is not a Guru! She is a woman that works on what she loves.","Vogue"
"I think instead of Marie Kongo showing up to this entitled brats apartment...someone should have sent and attitude adjuster that would teach respect, common decency, and good manners which seems to be lacking quite a bit in her spoiled behavior.  I know this was shown 2 year’s ago.....but seriously this still is annoying to see.  I hope Vogue at least paid her well to put up with such utter nonsense.","Vogue"
"she don't  need Guru Marie Kondo, she is doing just fine","Vogue"
"I agree.  Mari seemed more vested in this than you!  I felt as though you were disrespecting her and her method.  And ""give it a week??""","Vogue"
"Westerners are way too privileged.","Vogue"
"When an uncultured woman meets a cultured woman","Vogue"
"Hahaha....I love the part where you said, "" I have alot of joy"". I too have lots of things that bring joy : ) The arrangement of clothes like an econ graph which you know nothing about, was funny too. Thank you for this video. It was heartwarming...I enjoyed it.","Vogue"
"I’m in the process of reading her book. I found it at a thrift store and it’s completely changed my idea of what appreciation is and they represented her entire method as a joke. No appreciation at all. In her book she even mentions clients that would make tea for both of them out of politeness and even clients that have taken her to waterfalls to meditate. Japanese culture really is very appreciative but the way vogue represented her method really left a bad taste in my mouth. I’m happy she’s getting the recognition she deserves all in all","Vogue"
"this girl seemed like she was making fun of marie's methods. kinda surprised vogue okay-ed it :/","Vogue"
"Why Chloe always look annoyed in the videos?? If she’s so annoyed why not just stay behind the camera? The video is not about her okay","Vogue"
"this sweet asian lady deserves more than this !!","Vogue"
"The house owner is rude","Vogue"
"She was just being funny, it was ok. There was some other video where a host was actually shady, but this was fine to me.","Vogue"
"rude chloe","Vogue"
"This would be useful consulting
but whether the client continues on with what she's learned is the true issue/solution
xD","Vogue"
"Watch the British video of Marie (the pool channel) THAT video showed how to properly represent Marie and RESPECT her way of organizing even when it's a culture shock.","Vogue"
"The white girl is and EDITOR oh for God's sake what kind of ""educated"" people are in America.","Vogue"
"The white girl really represented her people really badly. You hardly ever see Americans with respect these days.","Vogue"
"'Presenter' comes across as rude and disrespectful.","Vogue"
"Kondo haha","Vogue"
"You suck.","Vogue"
"Such rude and disrespectful video Vogue.","Vogue"
"How she is not trying to learn more about Marie's culture and how she is not trying to be really nice with humor can be offensive to others but I'm not hating I love vogue and respect them this is not such a good video in my opinion","Vogue"
"Aweee she’s so adorable","Vogue"
"And this rude woman is the social editor ? Ok Vogue.","Vogue"
"It didn't come off as disrespectful to me. I thought they were trying to be funny about it.","Vogue"
"I think the problem with this video was how it was mostly Chloe speaking and not enough of Marie. And also how short the video was; it didn't get into enough depth on the konmari method. Everything was just glossed over. I've noticed that with a lot of her videos.","Vogue"
"This video is just dreadful. The sheer disrespect which she shows to Marie is revolting. I mean, was that gross sarcastic undertone really necessary? Is Vogue really paying this woman just for her to be to be this rude?","Vogue"
"Thankyou gozaimasu... so rude.","Vogue"
"Chloe Malle is the kind of person that gives Americans a bad name -- crass, entitled, self-centered, and superficial. You can also tell by the intonation in her voice that she is the kind of person more interested in consumption than culture. Willing to bet that the family that raised her is no different.","Vogue"
"This is dumb","Vogue"
"hi guys. i'm Japanese　learning english. i have a qestion for you guys. why did people say this video so rude for her? i just want to know the reason. please tell me some kind people.","Vogue"
"I don’t think this girl meant to be rude to KonMarie, she is just typical no manners, unrefined, almost uncultured person.","Vogue"
"THIS WAS SO CRINGY TO WATCH! This was blatantly disrespectful towards Marie!","Vogue"
"The woman with Mary is really rude and not well behaved.","Vogue"
"0:34 Marie Kondo's reacting to the Johnny Cash shirt.","Vogue"
"Her book has been a godsend to many. I think that Candice Bergen's daughter was just being young, but I understand why people were disturbed by her tone. She really has made many people's lives better, and we do feel what is akin to a reverence for the wonderful Ms. Kondo.","Vogue"
"Sorry to be like the 200th person to comment on this, but: this was super rude and inappropriate. It was cringy and disrespectful. If I was Marie Kondo, i would want Vogue to put this down.","Vogue"
"Obviously, this editor didn't bother to read her books(or the manga)! I hope she has now. I think that the books provide a better understanding as to why her method is something to be respected. I instantly adopted her method because it only makes sense to do so after reading her books. You'd think it'd be common sense. But no. Thank you, Marie Kondo. Less really is more.","Vogue"
"Sooooo rude! If you can’t be open minded and experience other people’s culture, why are you doing this video? I would be honored to have this experience","Vogue"
"This video is really offensive and all the comments agree. But the thumbs down are just a bunch..","Vogue"
"How bitchy you look when you say ""arigato gozaimas"" take it seriously...","Vogue"
"This video is a shame! So disrespectful!","Vogue"
"true definition of a privileged ungrateful bitch","Vogue"
"Oooh man if ever I'd have the privilege of having Ms. Kondo help me sort off my stuff I'd be really grateful and just enjoy the ritual of decluttering......","Vogue"
"It's MariÉ Kondo. Not Mari Kondo. It's very disrespectful and careless to not even research the name of the person. Americans are stupid and rude. Marie introduces herself in every interview - have enough brains to at least get the name right. Marie is a genius who is helping millions, and an idiot like Chloe doesn't even deserve her presence.","Vogue"
"Sorry for my english, I´m from Mexico City living in Austin TX, I took Marie Kondo´s seminar in NY, I do have all the respect for this woman.
Chloe Malle was so not respectful in this video, when KonMari greed the house, Chloe said something like not believing in what KonMari was doing, and the way she mention the way KonMari recommends to place the clothes on the closet. Chloe cut give a smile at least one time, but not any happy face in the whole video, it´s like she was told to do that interview, but she did not wanted to do it.
Chloe: I don´t like you.
Marie KonMari Kondo: I admire You. You are a life changer for many people, Thank you, KonMari.","Vogue"
"Marie at 0:34 lol","Vogue"
"I don't think that this girl has ever even read Marie's book. And she could just say 'thank you' on English, instead of just sounding rude.","Vogue"
"How often does Marie Kondo wash floors? That's definitely not a once-in-a-lifetime event :-)","Vogue"
"That woman is Social Editor? Ok, Vogue, okey...","Vogue"
"Rude","Vogue"
"hhhhh amazing u made her a super woman. .. I think she is amazing but she doesn't do anything new. ... what happens people u don't know how to organise your own home! !!! u kidding me! !!! I felt that I am also a super hero. ..","Vogue"
"I need Marie Kondo. Please Kondo-sensei, help me.","Vogue"
"I'm obsessed with the shelving units Chloe has around her bed. Those built-ins are super cool.","Vogue"
"she is not feeling it. she is just throwing stuff kinda makes me nervous....","Vogue"
"I stopped the video when this lady said she was greeting the floor boards. According to other comments this sarcasm will continue through the whole video. Bad job!","Vogue"
"Ah the clued-out Westerner meets the Eastern Guru.  They should really try to turn this concept into a film.  Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth :-p","Vogue"
"girl looks like she´s making fun about the method","Vogue"
"The most disrespectful video of Marie  ever ..... That girl seemed so rude and unprofessional","Vogue"
"I'm gonna give it a day maybe. Honestly, three hours, top.","Vogue"
"I love the konmari method...really changed me permanently on how I approach cleaning, letting go of things and keeping my place tidy. This video did come off as disrespectful in my opinion...","Vogue"
"Marie Kondos face responding to the Johnny Cash tshirt","Vogue"
"Chloe comes off as rude like this was a waste of her time. I'm not trying to be mean, but if she didn't act disrespectful this would have been much more palatable. What a waste of time and effort on Marie Kondo's part. Vogue should have chosen someone more sincere to do this video.","Vogue"
"fuck you vogue","Vogue"
"OMG how vogue dare to present a video so disrespectful shame on you.","Vogue"
"Marie Kondo, please come to my house. I'll treat you like royalty :)","Vogue"
"Marie Kondo's work invites gently to confrontation with ourselves through our objects and explains in detail how that is an inner dialogue. The person in the video looks sad, tired, dispirited, mocking and says of his own things ... ""death execution"" !? It really is a shame that have cited such a friendly and human person as Marie to make this video. Horror, Vogue.","Vogue"
"Wow, she was being pretty rude and disrespectful. ""Oh we got some Japanese maid coming over, she doesn't speak English so whatever, let's get this over with"" was the tone I got from this...","Vogue"
"I know it might sound silly to say ""thank you"" to those clothes you no longer need, but when you pause for a moment to realize that you were blessed by having these items (and perhaps will bless someone else now), you feel positive.","Vogue"
"this ""host"" needing help is rude af. shouldve left the room a mess. probably will be soon with that attitude.","Vogue"
"Obnoxious.  She is not funny at all if that was what she was aiming at.  Sorry that Marie wasted her time dealing with this chick.","Vogue"
"Surprised the Vogue communications team let this get published. It's disrespectful and off brand.","Vogue"
"I agree with the comments. You sounded quite rude and disrespectful. Almost like making fun of Marie for welcoming the house and saying thank you to the clothes. She does that for a reason- maybe read the book. So many people would love to have the opportunity to have Marie help them. It's pronounced ""Ma-ri-eh"" like in Japanese.","Vogue"
"I am utterly obsessed with Vogue's YouTube channel.","Vogue"
"Cant stand this. She's being immature and rude. Atleast show some respect. I dont even know why Vogue uploaded this, it should be neutral and doesnt just focus on one person's opinion/point of view. Especially if its coming from someone ignorant. The reason Marie asked her to say thank you to her old clothes so that she feel thankful and grateful spiritually. I dont get why she have to say thank you in Japanese clearly she's just making fun of this. We learn nothing from this video but negativity. Vogue please just delete this video.","Vogue"
"Hilarious video! People need to stop being offended in the comments for Marie. I'm sure she can hold her own without your help. Get a life!","Vogue"
"I too find the behavior of this vogue editor rather rude and disrespectful. I would advise all of you who feel the same way, which taken by the comments seems to be a great amount of people, to report this video for ""hateful or abusive content"" / ""promoting hatred or violence"" as this should not make an example as to how one should deal with a foreign culture, or any human being, anyway.","Vogue"
"i hope you gave it more than a week. it takes longer than that to change habits.","Vogue"
"so rudeeee. you are so lucky to have this kind of access and help jfc","Vogue"
"Her house looks so amazing","Vogue"
"I really don't understand the flippant, privileged and pretty rude attitude that Chole directs at Maire Kondo. It's so off-putting.","Vogue"
"i dont like this video. this woman shows NO respect for all the hard work marie has done to develope her method. neither she makes an effort to understand her and the meaning of her actions. she looks like an ignorant yankee that came from a distant farm and thinks has no need to understand other's culture just because she's from the US.","Vogue"
"Great <3","Vogue"
"Guys please go check out my vlog at Devon house and Carib in Jamaica. Thnx","Vogue"
"Are you trying to come off as funny, Vogue ?? Since when acting like a surly teenager is cute? Disrespectful!!!","Vogue"
"Don't give it a week, the KonMarie experience actually works!","Vogue"
"Just bought her book!","Vogue"
"Ahhhh you Americans and your lack of understanding for sarcastic humor😂 (Not all Americans though ofcorse)","Vogue"
"I love the end when she said 'I'm gonna give it a week'!","Vogue"
"She said I give a week. If she was serious with tidying up and just to make a video, then a rebound should not happen.","Vogue"
"Hahaha love this! Arigato 🙏🏽","Vogue"
"I agree with everyone, whatever humor that Chloe was scripted to do or is her natural personality, came off extremely condescending. ""Arigato...thank you very much... uh gozaimasu.."" Her tone seemed as though she wasn't enthusiastic to have a organization guru, who has helped many people with her method, to organize her closet and seemed to look down on Marie as a foreigner with a different culture. When Marie asks her to thank the piece of clothing you can see Chloe look back at the camera like Marie is crazy. I've read that many celebrities use the KonMari method and Vogue should have recruited the to make this video.","Vogue"
"I found Chloe's tone to be both unprofessional and rude. She spoke as if she hadn't even read Marie Kondo's book. Vogue, if this is the caliber of your editors then I think your standard is dropping.","Vogue"
"Pray for the house, thank to clothes. She has Shinto mind. I like her method.","Vogue"
"Agree with commenters. This is in poor taste.","Vogue"
"こんまりさん！！♥","Vogue"
"Rude","Vogue"
"I'm so proud of her as a Japanese:)","Vogue"
"I love him so much ugh","Vogue"
"OK, but who was the black boy with the blonde afro???","Vogue"

"I love you Lucky 😍😍😍😍","Vogue"
"Anyone know the name of the model with the Afro who echoed him?","Vogue"
"He's such so perfect😻","Vogue"
"He's smokin 😳❤️❤️❤️😂😍😍😍","Vogue"
"it's 2016 though, why is the video quality still bad, was this all taken by the front camera","Vogue"
"Seems pretty awesome to be good-looking.","Vogue"

"tbh I would fucking cut a bitch if those annoying girls screamed at me all the time and chased my cat","Vogue"
"Nobody's perfect but to me he is perfect. His looks, his voice, his personality👌🏽","Vogue"
"Those girls remind me of kpop crazy fans who chase around their idol's car haha and i am one of them","Vogue"
"Omg and to think that i have spoken to him before he was famous..","Vogue"
"best part: be carefull please be carefull.. wuhahahahahahahahahaha","Vogue"
"omg girls can be embarrasing at times","Vogue"
"Holy shit teenage girls are the worst!","Vogue"
"Okay, idk y but i didnt like him but i gotta admit.... HE IS F...ING TALL !!!! EVEN I WANT TO BE TALL","Vogue"
"He is sooooooooo ugly , my god","Vogue"
"Lucky should be a bit more conscious with what's he's putting in his body. Coke, yunk food, etc etc. Need to persevere that beautiful face and body he has.","Vogue"
"Why are girls so obsessed? He's just a guy who happens to be a male model...","Vogue"
"CAMERON DALLAS .. honestly though. he does look like him IMO","Vogue"
"If this was about a female model, she wouldn't be aloud to eat junk food.","Vogue"
"From the thumbnail, I thought it was a female model.","Vogue"
"Luckyyyyy!","Vogue"
"so overrated","Vogue"
"""Please be careful! Please be careful!"" ok that was cute","Vogue"
"he is so careing to his fans love him.👌😍","Vogue"
"he seems really sweet and down to earth :3","Vogue"
"I think if he was just called John or Chris no-one would pay any attention to him! He's sweet but I thought he was Frida Gustavvson.","Vogue"
"He looks female?? I honestly think many, many girls must want to be with other girls because the men they seek out look female!","Vogue"
"David Bowie","Vogue"
"Is it that deep? I swear there's other models ya know. I love lucky but people need to chill","Vogue"
"This is like when Smith Jerrod from Sex and the City was the Absolut Hunk LOL","Vogue"

"I don't get it, who is this guy?","Vogue"
"How does he eat so much","Vogue"
"Does he act? Has he ever considered it? He looks a lot like the image I have of one of my novel's characters...","Vogue"
"Damn, I want Michael Lockley's hair...","Vogue"
"We dont ... we don't care.","Vogue"
"Will you do a 73 Questions again soon?","Vogue"

"so gooood","Vogue"
"I really enjoyed this collection.","Vogue"
"How can you get tickets for this?","Vogue"
"I am constantly waiting for them to actually do a collection that deserves the amount of attention they get. When will we stop supporting mediocrity? They have never done anything worth the amount of attention they get. There are thousands of other designers with more interesting/original ideas who do not get an 1/8th of the attention these two receive and I just dont understand it? As a consumer and someone who follows fashion closely i'm constantly smh.","Vogue"
"Maybe I'm reading too much into body language... but I can't help but feel that they were really tight at one point but now there's bad blood between them???","Vogue"
"Wherever.......","Vogue"
"public school always comes through with such great collections!!","Vogue"

"amazing! it never gets old!","Vogue"
"Loved them aaaaaall","Vogue"
"There were some great pieces but some I did not care for... Some dresses should not have been in the collections, it was distracting. Some fabric clashed with others. A little confusing. 🤓","Vogue"
"i like that they stay consistent but always bring something new to the table
beautiful","Vogue"
"Oscar's pieces are just so elegant and beautiful!","Vogue"
"These pieces are absolutely gorgeous and unlike the majority of the other designers', the clothes are actually wearable. You can wear these in public without the 'wtf' stares. 
Oscar de La Renta never lets me down.","Vogue"
"I am living for these pieces. Beautiful","Vogue"

"you know, that bitch really does think about everything when it comes to the fashion industry, i appreciate the fact that she at least is willing to bring up and discuss these topics/issues","Vogue"
"No Yeezy,  Ana? 😉","Vogue"
"Proenza and Rodate were clearly the best shows of the season. Honourable mention to Marchaesa just because every single piece that came down that runway was STUNNING!","Vogue"
"I agree with Anna entirely on being a little let down by the shows this season. There were only a handful that really stood out and the rest were just kind of blah. I'm hoping for some stand out collections to come out of Milan and Paris; fingers crossed!","Vogue"
"I mean obviously there is a lot of work to be done when it comes to diversity, but I think Zac Posen and HBA have helped push it along!","Vogue"
"ANNA WINTOUR KILLED THE ZOOLANDER CAMEO, ily","Vogue"
"the collections are look so similar at the moment!!!! there is a major different between a trend ( a thread that runs through a season) to hundreds of collections that merge into a monochrome, sporty, minimalistic blur","Vogue"

"I was really excited about watching the documentary since I'm working on my thesis which is about fashion and I also visited C
China through the looking glass in May 2015. And after watching them prepare so thoroughly they invited a bunch of rich in most cases uneducated people who would never be able to appreciate and connect to the whole thing the way their team did. I mean Rihanna, as popular and beautiful as she is, almost made my eyes and ears bleed when she chose to sing bitch better have my money on that stage, and Justin Bieber howling in one of the rooms. I mean it spoils everything, their attitude and ridiculous comments. Somehow those 800 000 people who came to the exhibition after them seem to me  more appreciative and perceiving, than most of Wintour's guests. But they did raise a lot of money, so I guess it's like fashion - there has to be a balance between art and commerce.","Vogue"

"I'm probably not the first one to say it, but the Met Gala is the ugliest face of fashion: a bunch of over-paid and over-privileged people wearing ridiculous dresses resembling glittery shower curtains. Instead of something as tasteful as Capote's Black and White Ball, we get to see Anna Wintour's display of tacky fashion victims flaunting their new boobjobs.","Vogue"

"I lost all the respect that I had for Anna Wintour when she decided to rub shoulders with the Kardashians (and Kanye) and allowing them to go to the MET Gala and being on the cover of Vogue. It saddens me that a woman that I thought was classy and sophisticated gave in and instead of giving a voice to people that matter and actually have talent, just mixes with classless women without any talent that are only famous because of a tape and for showing constantly how vulgar they are in social media. Remarkable women fought really hard throughout history for women's rights and look what happened and what examples we have now. This type of people should not be given coverage but I guess Anna Wintour is just like them. I do not buy Vogue magazines anymore and I lost all the respect that I had for Anna Wintour but I guess my opinion is irrelevant as I am a nobody compared to the Kardashians, right?","Vogue"

"I was so excited about this until I realized this wasn't about the upcoming MET Gala but the previous one; their attempt to portray China without being orientalist is much appreciated but for me it still failed to be accurate enough (likely because the theme hit too close to home).

"Fendi has done it again!!!! I love the abstract, art-deco influences with those waves and stripes. Sort of reminds me of what J.W Anderson did with those peplum, kinetic motion stuff but it looks completely different and has a completely different energy. The set I always breathtaking as always. There are a few designers whose creations can be classified as art and Fendi is certainly one of them. It is art but wearable art. Karl and Silvia know how to make things that look amazing visually and have a unique story and value to them but can do so well on the retail floor, especially the bags this season and the shoes which I am positive will be sold out everywhere.","Vogue"
